A REMINDER ON REPLICATION

Replication of the original project environment is important. The project structure here aims
to provide two methods of environment creation for the conda package manager

Conda environment creation works with environment.yml files. To create an environment.yml file, run the following
command in an Anaconda interpreter before loading it all into GitHub:

conda env export --from-history -f environment.yml

The resulting environment.yml file will include ONLY the packages you have explicitly installed using the conda
package manager. These packages will then download their own dependencies. This will effectively create a cross-
platform environment creation script.

<! ATTENTION !>

Some packages cannot be installed using only conda package manager. After the file is created,
be sure to include such dependencies under the "DEPENDENCIES:" tag following this format 

-pip --> Pip itself must be installed for the pip installs to work
-pip:
   - PIP PACKAGE_1
   - PIP PACKAGE_2

<! ATTENTION !>

One must also include the project itself as a package so that the scripts and tests can work with imports.
As above, include this line under the "-pip:" header:

-pip:
   - e . --> This is to make sure that the project gets installed as a package.
	   Needed for tests and general functioning.


After you are done with extracting the environment, you should create a dodo.py file to use with the doit module.
See the DAG protocol for information about the dodo.py file.
