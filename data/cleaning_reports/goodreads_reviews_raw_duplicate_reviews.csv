I loved the book. In the midst of a murder mystery and love story set in late 16th century Istanbul, artists in a workshop supported by the sultan debate the role and perspective of miniaturists in illustrating religious and secular texts. The lead characters and numerous well-developed supporting characters carry the story along through a wide range of perspectives and through engaging discussions about art, family and love."
11/04/2021,b1,r302,62996943,James Resendes,"May 03, 2018",4,"A murder mystery set in late 16th century Istanbul, this book is just as much about art history as it is historical fiction. I learned heaps about the influence of Venetian style and perspective on Ottoman art, which really serves as the basis of the entire plot.. But because there was such focus on painting as an art form, I did find it difficult to become wholly invested in the characters themselves, and in doing so, felt as though the tension building in the plot often fell flat. And as interested as I was in all of the philosophy of art, it made the novel a dense read, one I couldn’t just pick up and spend 10 mins with on my morning commute.. Lush, thoughtful, but definitely an okay-I’m-gonna-sit-down-and-rEAD-now kind of book."
11/04/2021,b1,r303,82964590,Nazanin Moayed,"Aug 06, 2018",4,"As it’s written on the back of the book, My Name is Red is a kaleidoscope journey to the intersection of art, religion, love, sex and power.. It took me around 2 months or more to read this book, but it was worth the time spent. Though it’s a thick book, it never bored me or made me tired, as every chapter was narrated by a different character, reading the same story from different points of view was really interesting to me. Moreover the author surprises you in every couple of chapters by coming up with something brilliant and new; such as an unpredictable event, a new character or revelation of a mystery. In my opinion what makes this book special is the proficiency of the author in characterization, not only main human characters like Black Effendi, Shekure, Eshter, Enishte Effendi and... have their very special and different features but also things! Some chapters are narrated by things like a coin, a painting, or even a color!. I highly recommend “My Name is Red” to those who take joy in reading tales like “One Thousand and One Night”. Stories that take to a whole new world full of colors, illuminations and delicate ornamentations..."
11/04/2021,b1,r304,79151982,Zvart,"Mar 28, 2019",5,"“My Name is Red"" by Orhan Pamuk has a creative structure and organizational scheme.. The characters are thoughtful and articulate, and they convey their ideas and beliefs powerfully, often doing so by addressing the reader directly.. I love reading Pamuk especially because I feel me part of this different culture, I mean Turkey and Islam it's something about which I really do not know a lot. So If you are a person who likes to discover different characters and cultures you must read this book :)"
11/04/2021,b1,r305,28503927,Greg Hickey,"Oct 21, 2020",3,"I like the idea of this book more than I liked this particular variation. Like Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose, My Name Is Red is a literary, historical mystery that goes beyond the traditional whodunit and explores questions of religion, art and warring cultures. The multitude of shifting narrators and Pamuk's deft management of characters and clues makes for a well-crafted intellectual mystery. But ultimately, I'm just not that interested in 16th-century Turkish artwork, and that detracted from my enjoyment of the rest of the story."
11/04/2021,b1,r306,25644472,Snigdha Agarwal,"Dec 10, 2017",2,"Appreciate the writer's imagination that it actually takes one to the past. However, more than being a murder mystery it was just a repetitive rant on miniaturists and their life. The synopsis needs to improve on that front. After a few 100 pages it feels like a drag and I struggled to complete it. If it were a much smaller book, I would have rated it higher for its unique writing style and exemplar recreation of 16th century Persia in the reader's mind."
11/04/2021,b1,r307,110137050,Fuegoflames,"Feb 21, 2020",4,"I experienced a lot of friction while reading this novel. The writing is exceptional however, and Pamuk structures the novel in a way that forced me to slow down to truly understand the plot, especially when significant cultural factors are explored. I am not familiar with it, but I now have a better understanding of a fragment of Islamic / Turkish culture. The ending is not what I expected, or wanted, but it is nonetheless a 'good' read."

The Three-Body Problem. , I thought it probably had interesting ideas that I wasn't quite bright enough to fully appreciate.. As an art historian, I was better able to appreciate the ideas in. My Name is Red. , and there were some good ones: about religious and secular motivation for various perspectives and styles; the connections between memory, blindness, and art; and differences between the Eastern and Western worlds. The story-telling technique of handing the narrative, like a baton, between various characters (including, in the first chapter, the soul of a recent murder victim, and later even objects and the unnamed murderer) was also an interesting approach.. Unfortunately, it just wasn't pleasurable reading. It was a slow slog, with a plot that was contemplative at best and deliberately foot-dragging at worst, and, most unforgivably, a host of characters that I simply couldn't care about at all, let alone like.. Reading challenge: #7, non-human characters; #10, mystery or thriller; #13, set in a different country; #20, non-American author; #29, set somewhere I've always wanted to visit; #41, author I've never read; #44, originally written in a different language."
11/04/2021,b1,r309,18183683,Khulud Khamis,"Jul 06, 2017",5,"This is a book worth spending a long time with. I spent more than two months with it, enjoying all the philosophy about art, representation of reality, solitude, and more. Pamuk goes really deep and it to let it all sink in slowly takes time. What was especially intriguing to me, as a writer, was the structure and the use of the multiple voices, especially the ones like the dog and the murdered man. This is a masterpiece."
11/04/2021,b1,r310,5826413,Coenraad,"Aug 02, 2017",5,"I know some readers found this novel heavy-going, confusing, etc - I relished the rich abundance of narrators, the detail about the time period, the different genres of stories weaved into each other. It is a favourtie, always to be reread - unfortunately, usually tomorrow!. Pamuk se karnaval van vertellers is een van my gunstelingromans ooit."
11/04/2021,b1,r311,16819062,S. ,"Jun 17, 2018",2,"I should've re-read Ferdausi instead.. or should I blind myself in the fashion of Bihzad after the fall of Herat ?. Some of the lines depicted the miniatures controversy and figuartive art in Islam, which was okay... Some of the miniaturists parables reminded me of the Shahnameh and other persian stories, and that sent me wondering why haven't I settled on reading some Nizami ?"
11/04/2021,b1,r312,49635284,Dolf van der Haven,"Apr 22, 2019",5,"A true masterpiece, justifiably leading to the author's Nobel Prize. Not only the style, with its continually changing perspectives, but also the ability of evoking 16th-century Istanbul and the world of miniaturists, are signs of a masterful author. Be sure to know your Persian classics before reading this novel!"
11/04/2021,b1,r313,51183187,Darren,"Sep 07, 2019",4,"Well-written blend of historical/murder-mystery along with elements of romance and humour, and an overwhelming paean to illustrative art. Never really felt sufficiently engaged with any of the characters though (Esther the clothier was my fave ""Clothiieeer!""). A book that is easy to read and easy to admire, but hard to love. 3.5 stars, rounding up cos 3 would be harsh."
11/04/2021,b1,r314,59150289,Ashley,"Feb 20, 2020",4,"Delightful descriptions, immersive integration of culture, and thought-provoking themes abound. It tested my intellectual maturity, if that makes sense, which I enjoyed. The ending moved slowly and then quickly, its purpose of wrapping things up quite clear and a deviation from the method of previous sections, which I didn’t quite enjoy."
11/04/2021,b1,r315,7349895,Debra Robert,"Sep 26, 2020",2,"This was an awful book for me. I read that it is not a good place to start reading Orhan. It took too long to start making sense of and read ultra slow.. This requires study and dedication. I was also getting depressed reading it. I can read dark books, but there was just something about it that kept me sullen and on edge. I’d rather read Faulkner over again and again."
11/04/2021,b1,r316,126156505,Sarah Plutnicki,"Jan 10, 2021",4,"overall a really interesting and well-written read. i haven’t learned too much about islamic styles of art before and it was interesting to see how religion, art and politics played out during this time period. i really loved the latter part of the book. there were moments where i wanted to skip through some of the chapters, but i ultimately do see the importance of having so much imagery language and historical anecdotes to the book as a whole. this book was definitely unlike anything i’ve read before."
11/04/2021,b1,r317,33251886,Magda Rewt,"Dec 21, 2018",3,This book does take a little getting used to. It used several characters to explain what is going on in different chapters so it can get rather confusing. It definitely drags on a lot too much so I had to put it down at times
11/04/2021,b1,r318,110441708,Benjamin,"Feb 21, 2020",0,"Ending is not satisfying however it is at least competent. Probably the best written work I have ever read. I would not have read it if I was not required to, but I will read it again in the future. I would recommend for anyone mature and over the age of sixteen."
11/04/2021,b1,r319,15721315,Stacey Falls,"Mar 29, 2020",3,"i think there was just a lot lost in translation for me, and it made it hard for me to fully enjoy this book. i mean that figuratively and literally. culturally, i just didn't really ""get it"". i didn't fully understand the controversy around the different types of art--the traditionalists vs. the frankish style...? and i really didn't care about which sultan or leader was in charge and what their view on art was.. i was sort of compelled by the love story.. but the mystery aspect of the story left me bewildered. all the characters sounded the same. none of them had unique voices or perspectives. whether they were miniaturists, wealthy patrons of the arts, murdered bodies, poor jewish peddlers, widowed women...they all seemed the same. maybe this was an issue with the translator, i don't know. but when the murderer was finally revealed, i didn't really care. i didn't have any attachment to any of the characters. i didn't suspect any of them.. i honestly am not sure why i even read the whole thing. there was something vaguely compelling.. the scenery was richly described. i loved the imagery of the royal treasury and the run down dervish temple. i could picture and revel in the energy of the coffee house. even the streets of istanbul were made alive and exciting.. but the pages and pages going through all the different illustrations and their historical relevance could have been edited out.. i'd love to understand all the acclaim this book received."

11/04/2021,b2,r631,69790898,Kamran Sehgal,"Jan 17, 2019",5,"As with his 'My Name is Red' I found the combination of characters, plot, and exploration of Turkey's crisis of identity the main draw. This book draws you in very well with these attributes."
11/04/2021,b2,r632,260987,Valerie F,"Jan 28, 2018",5,"Beautifully written, melancholy, describes well for non-Turks the contemporary struggle between secularism and stricter observance of Islam, as well as other historical conflicts with Armenians, Communists, and other groups."
11/04/2021,b2,r633,81014235,Stephen,"Dec 10, 2018",3,"I couldn’t make up my mind whether this was verbose or subtle. The writing is excellent with the author having a telling eye for a good phrase & gift of rendering a faithful image of this claustrophobic Turkish town & its varied inhabitants. The power struggle between the moderates & extremists on both the secular & religious sides is well depicted. Nobody is truly neutral in whatever field they operate in. If the book had stuck to that it would have, in my opinion, merited a 5 star review. Unfortunately, the painstaking literary angle (which allowed a lot of padding at the end in particular) added little. As long as Ka was a moderate secularist he could have been a bus driver rather than a poet & the book notably punchier as a result. Almost excellent but not quite."
11/04/2021,b2,r634,80943505,Saims,"Jan 29, 2020",5,"Bloody brilliant. It seemed like it was based on a true story, I may be wrong and in which case this was so beautifully written.. Essential reading"
11/04/2021,b2,r635,321314,Jeff Scott,"Aug 14, 2009",4,"This story is more of a vehicle to explore the different characters and issues of Turkey. Islamists, Atheists, terrorist, westerners, and those caught in between are all explored. In the end, the author's message is that we don't really understand any of them, that there's no way to do so.. The main character, KA, drives the plot. He returns to Kars, Turkey, from Frankfurt Germany so that he can woo and marry the woman of his dreams who is recently divorced. The author builds up the story to root for Ka. However, three quarters of the way into this story, we know there isn't a happy ending for the protaganist. He doesn't get the girl, in fact, we find that he will be shot and killed four years after the main events of the story.. Why do that to your reader? That seems a little mean to suddenly break into the story and write something like, ""Oh by the way, I need to interrupt your story. You know the main character, it doesn't really work out for him. You're not really supposed to pay attention to him anyway. He is just a vehicle to say what I want to say about Turkey and the certain characteristics about its inhabitants."" This isn't an actual quote, I'm just summing up my feelings. However, when I finished the book, and you find what Ka does in order to secure his own happiness, I think he deserved to be shot.. The story is a good story because you have all these characters that have misconceptions about everybody else. No one really understands anyone. They all have these built up and romanticized stories or to villainize Islamists, Atheists, Westerners, and others. There is no middle ground, just ridiculous notions. The author himself even says his own story is one of them and not to believe any of it. You can pull that content from the passages below.. Passages. ""We're not stupid we're just poor and we have a right to want to insist on this distinction...Mankind's greatest error, the biggest deception of the past 1000 years is this, to confuse poverty with stupidity. Throughout history, religious leaders and other honorable me of conscience have always warned against this shaming confusion. They remind us that the poor have hearts, minds, humanity, and wisdom, just like everyone else. When hans hanson sees a poor man he feels sorry for him. He would not necessarily assume that the man's a fool who's blown his chances or a drunk whose lost his will. I can't speak for hans hanson, but that's what everyone thinks when they see a poor man.. People might feel sorry for a man who has fallen on hard times, but when an entire nation is poor the rest of the world assumes that all. its people must be brainless, lazy, dirty, clumsy, fools. Instead of pity, the people provoke laughter. It's all a joke. Their culture, their customs, their practices. In time the rest of the world may some begin to feel ashamed for having thought this way, and when they look around and see the immigrants from that poor country mopping their floors and doing all the other lowest paying jobs, naturally, they worry about what might happen if these workers one day rose up against them. So, to keep things sweet they start taking an interest in immigrant's culture and sometimes even pretend they think. of them as equals...When a westerner meets a foreigner from a poor country, he feels contempt. He assumes that the poor man's head must be full of all the nonsense that plunged his country into poverty and despair."" p. 300. p. 400. I turned backed to Fazil and asked him what he would say to my readers if ever I was to write a book set in Kars.. ""Nothing"", his voice was determined. When he saw my face fall, he relented.. ""I did think of something, but you may not like it."" he said. ""If you write a book set in kaas, and put me in it, I'd like to tell your readers not to believe anything you say about us, anything you say about any of us, no one could understand us from so far away."". ""But no one believes in that way what he reads in a novel."" I said. ""Oh YES they do"" he cried, ""If only to see themselves as wise and superior and humanistic. They need to think of us as sweet and funny and convince themselves that they sympathize with the way we are and even love us. But if you had put in what I just said at least your readers will put a little room for doubt in their minds."""
11/04/2021,b2,r636,9314075,Carl R.,"May 06, 2012",5,"One of the jacket blurbs on the paperback edition of Orhan Pamuk’s Snow declares that the book heralds the return of the political novel. I don’t know that the political novel ever went away or, indeed, what a political novel is, exactly, but I do know that the phrase cannot contain this first-drawer work of literature.. Snow’s themes and ideas are complex enough to absorb seminars by themselves. Isolation--political, psychological, romantic, artistic--is but one of the concepts that is intertwined in the interior and exterior lives of the characters as well as the overall action of the novel. The concept of authority--where it rests and how it is exercised in government, families, friendships--moves the plot through the streets of the storm-isolated town of Kars where the novel is set. Kars itself is at once the place where nearly all the action occurs and a metaphor for Turkey and even for the emotional lives of the characters. The analyst who diagrammed the travels of protagonist Ka through its streets might be rewarded with meaning kin to Leopold Bloom’s meanderings through Dublin. And these don’t begin to exhaust what all could be termed main themes. The book is resplendent with them.. Literature itself is a main character. The protagonist Ka is a writer who has come to Kars ostensibly to report as a journalist (though he is primarily a poet) on the upcoming elections. He has endured a long creative dry spell, but his return to the town of his youth sparks new inspiration, and he writes a number of poems. The reader gets to see very little of their content, but the occasions for their composition are all integral to the movement of the action. And, once again, a study of their order and the circumstances under which they were written could consume a considerable course of study.. Important also, arguably the most important, is the title metaphor. Snow isolates Kars for most of the time the novel spends there. It controls the actions and thoughts of many of the characters. The pivotal events would be impossible without it. Artistically and psychologically, the structure of the snowflake becomes not only a figure for Ka’s interior life, but a diagram for universal system of thought, artistry, and psychology. Exploring its ramifications would reward a great deal study. Ka places his Kars poems, for example, in various locations on the diagram of the snowflakes six poles according to a system of concepts and emotions he has devised. And that system is meant to reflect no less than a structure of the universe. A cliche idea, I thought, to see the universe in a snowflake, no two of which are alike as we’ve been told and told and told. But Pamuk renders the whole idea marvelous.. Adding still another dimension to all this complexity is the narrator, who we think at first is the omniscient author, but who soon turns out to be someone who knows or has known the protagonist in the past, then turns out to be someone who is a bit of detective trying to sort out . . . but I’m giving too much away. The novel is in one sense a mystery along with all its other senses.. Finally, on the political/cultural level, westerners seldom get a chance at insight into the mind of the Muslim world. I’m not talking here about political posturing or slaughter of innocents or quaint costumes. I’m talking about a first-rate artist showing us what it means to live constantly with the idea that your culture is inferior, playing catchup with a world that has passed you by and judges you while glancing over its shoulder as it speeds far down the road ahead. It’s not an idea you necessarily accept or live by, but it permeates your world like a bad smell you can’t get rid of. Snow gave me some insight into why cultural understanding is so difficult to achieve, and it didn’t give me a great deal of hope that it was going to happen in the near future.. However, Snow did reinforce my conviction that art can transcend--at least for the space of a book or ballet or play or symphony--all the bombs and hatred-spewing presidents and Ayatollahs. And to anyone who cares to take the trouble the exploration of just this one work of Pamuk’s could last for years. I’m not going to dive in to that extent, but I am going to read more of this Nobel guy. Come back later and see what I come up with."
11/04/2021,b2,r637,1993309,Kristel,"Apr 27, 2014",3,"Short synopsis: A story set in Kars, Turkey. Ka, a poet, visits on assignment to write about the suicides of young women. His reason for being there is Ipek who he plans to bring back to Germany as his wife. It is snowing……. Reactions: at first I wanted to like this story, it has been described as poetic and I think that is accurate for the first part of the book but it is also as boring as looking at a snow covered landscape devoid of color. I think the author had something going by using the snow to describe the experience of Ka but then it just “melted”. At first, I felt resentment. I did not like that the Islamist kept telling others how they were thinking. It made me hate this religion. There is no grace or mercy here. Its hard for me to understand the intolerance for Christianity and the blindly tolerant view of Islam. Then there was some enlightenment. The mixed messages that people living in Kars receive through communism or socialism, Islam, etc was evident. The girls raised to wear a scarf, taught that it was expected in their religion and then told to “take the scarf off”. The confusion caused by the mixing of politics with religion and the manipulation used by the various parties. No one seemed to think it was wrong to lie and to harm others if it promoted the agenda.. I first I thought I could like Ka but I could not. I could understand wanting to meet up with a former acquaintance and propose and get married. I think that is an okay goal but when he started being devious and manipulative in his endeavors, then I no longer was happy with him. The interest in pornography had also crippled him, in my opinion. He was a weak man and in the end he just went too far with his jealousies.. The authors purpose: Mr Pamuk states that he wanted to write a novel that would explore the political conflicts in Turkey. He used a small town to give a microcosm view of the whole. He discusses in the postscript how difficult it is to write a political novel about this area and apparently there were political persecutions for which he had to hire a lawyer. The book involved a not of careful editing. The author is a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2006. His partner is the author, Kiran Desai.. Why is it included in 1001 Books you Must Read Before You Die? Is there anything that this book adds to the development of the novel? I suspect that because this is a work that looks at political Islam, clash of Western and Islam and that the author is Turkey that this book is unique. The use of lyrical prose and the technique where the author writes himself into the story is not unique. Characters were frequently stereotypes. Ka was developed. The other characters represented certain characters and classes in the microcosm of Turkey. The language did create the scene, the use of snow was ‘smart’ in keeping everyone contained in this drama for three days and the tone was set by the snow. The book had emotional impact though not necessarily positive for me. I am glad to be done. I think the author probably deserved the Nobel Prize for literature for being able to write this controversial and potentially risky novel.. I also wanted to add this quote; ""If only to see themselves as wise and superior and humanistic, they need to think of us as sweet and funny, and convince themselves that they sympathize with the way we are and even love us."" page 442. I think this is very true (but not for me). I don't like their religion or their politics."
11/04/2021,b2,r638,1455091,Ryan,"Feb 02, 2011",2,"Seems appropriate for a 4-day snow day from school... Plus I've been wanting to read another Islamic account of life in the Middle East besides Kite Runner and Thousand Splendid Suns.... _______________________________________________________________________. Boring… Oh my God, I'm so glad I'm done... I have no idea how to go about my response to this book. I so disliked it that I don’t even feel like taking the time to detail and justify every reason why. I felt absolutely nothing throughout – nothing for the characters (whom I thought were lifeless, with nothing to back them up), nothing for the plot (which was not suspenseful, had no momentum, and frankly seemed hard to keep track of with the Turkish names, places, and the guise of the theater crew running a [real?] coup), and nothing for “the cause” (which I couldn’t even decipher).. I was so excited to read a “real” portrayal of Islamic culture after my disappointment with “The Kite Runner” and “A Thousand Splendid Suns.” I thought those two novels were too popularized, not as piercing as they could be, not as poetic and psychologically insightful as could be – (though I CERTAINLY found out how offended douche-bag fans of Hossieni could be if you do not agree with their love and infatuation…) However, I’m almost MORE disappointed with this, having had such higher expectations.. You would think that a love story set in the time of Islamic Revolution in the Middle East would be a dynamic, captivating, exciting story. However, I felt like nothing was believable in this. There was a coup – where performers openly fire on an audience – that doesn’t seem plausible; there was a love story – where our protagonist falls in love within seconds and then proceeds to act romantically robotic to her and with her; there was a main character who, as a poet, seemingly found his way into every single turn of events – really? The poet? So crucial to life, the revolution, religious leaders, feminists, the secret police? Everything must pass though him? Even the Islamic struggle didn’t really feel as sure and powerful as the news on TV lately does. Yes, there is the government, the religious leaders, the feminists – but their struggles seemed “dumbed down” or simplified or reduced to stereotypes, simple symbols, or just accepted as “common belief.” The women fight for 400 pages over the right to kill themselves or to take scarves off their heads. The Islamists think anyone who doesn’t want to follow Sharia Law is an atheist and they won’t speak to them. Our main character walks around aimlessly waiting for poems to miraculously come to him, all while solving the crisis everyone has around him.. I don’t know…. I’m not even sure I’m representing this 100% correctly, but just like when I was reading the book, I don’t care. I wasn’t drawn in enough to follow it, or care enough to follow it. I should have stopped after page 200 but I can’t leave a book unfinished. But this seriously took me twice as long to get through as a normal book, I seriously fell asleep while reading countless times, and I finally just “sped read” through each sentence/paragraph to get through it as fast as possible. How is it possible that a book with this subject matter could not come across to the reader in a more urgent, gripping, dynamic fashion? I'm still looking for an accurate, moving, poetic look at the Islamic countries we hear so much about nowadays..."
11/04/2021,b2,r639,6652736,Dima Lababidi,"Jan 01, 2019",5,"Snow by Orhan Pamuk was one of those books that change your perspective entirely about wars, military coups, political and religious leaders who think they’re powerful and really just how human everyone around us is. I loved Necip and the charcoal station dog and the effect the snow left on everything it touched, but I hated the snow itself, and I don’t hate Ka, I really think he’s so human. No wonder Pamuk won the Nobel Prize for this novel. He’s a master of story telling and painting images for the readers. This is always gonna be one of my top 10 favorite books."
11/04/2021,b2,r640,1086452,Dia,"Dec 13, 2009",3,"One of the back-cover blurbs (by John Updike) uses the word ""tonic"" to describe this book, a descriptor I don't remember ever seeing applied to a written work but which immediately provoked an appetite for this one. In the end, I didn't really feel that this book was a tonic -- I'm not sure that it's even possible for literature to be tonic, interesting though that prospect is.. Nonetheless, this book has much to recommend it. It's set in contemporary Turkey, a place that, as the Turks in this book are well aware, we Americans and other Westerners know little about. The book is far from didactic or moralistic; in fact it probably falls more onto the absurdist side of things, albeit tempered by moments of yearning and near-fulfillment that might be called romantic (although those moments come in an unnervingly clockwork manner: every time something frightening happens, the man we are following notices the beautiful snow, recalls his lover, or writes a pristine poem -- but these romantic moments are almost more like the tics of a person tormented by an unpredictable punisher than they are the effusions of a daisy-picking universe-communer).. The guiding question of this book is universal, not particular to Westernized Islamic countries, as is expressed in the following dialogue:. ""...Listen to me: Life's not about principles, it's about happiness."". ""But if you don't have any principles, and if you don't have faith, you can't be happy at all,"" said Kadife.. ""That's true. But in a brutal country like ours where human life is cheap, it's stupid to destroy yourself for the sake of your beliefs. Beliefs, high ideals -- only people living in rich countries can enjoy such luxuries."". ""Actually, it's the other way round. In a poor country, the only consolation people can have is the one that comes from their beliefs."". The book certainly shows people, and not just poor people, looking for consolation in every possible place and not achieving it in any lasting way, changing their commitments as they become disillusioned or as it becomes politically necessary to do so. This endless identity- and happiness-seeking activity seemed familiar enough to this Westerner.. Perhaps more particular to its locale, the characters in this book display a palette of emotional response that I would guess is foreign to, or perhaps suppressed by, most Westerners. That people can be truly terrified that they might become atheists; that people can be truly ashamed that they are whatever nationality they are; that the dominant experience one has of love is the near certainty that one will lose the beloved: These were some recurring emotional responses of characters in this book that English-speaking readers might not identify with but will be drawn toward by the passion and precision of the writing.. For all the absurdity, sociopolitical provocations, and despair contained in this book, it is somehow not a gloomy tome. Perhaps it's the snow lacing the pages, or the invisible poems, that do provide some tonic to help one digest this book. Though the book (like this review!) is a bit too long, the whiffs of Kundera, Murakami, and even Raymond Chandler, keep it moving. It's a skillful author whose very serious book feels so light in one's hands."
11/04/2021,b2,r641,10706328,Nethra Ram,"Dec 21, 2013",2,"Unfortunately my first DNF this year. I've been wanting to read this book for quite some time and I was initially blown away by the poetic writing and the grim circumstances bring discussed. But the grand welcome stops right there.. 1. I don't think you'll understand the various standpoints in this book, without having a prior knowledge of the religious and political differences underlined as a lifestyle in Kars. Without those hints you'll have a tough time rounding up who supports whom before you can even decide if someone's reasoning is justifiable. This becomes a major problem as the book progresses because it'll just plainly confuse you.. 2. I like the idea of including the author as a character in the book...I do not know if the narrator friend is the author himself because I didn't finish it, but this guy gets very annoying at times. When the point of view suddenly shifts in the middle of a tense situation, to first person, the friend telling you he hasn't seen Ka in years, or something equally unimportant, you'll want to tell him 'Shh dude, will you just shut up for a moment?' Plus, having Ka's sexual feelings described in the words of a friend, is in my opinion a little gross.. 3. The conflict and confusion that Ka faces, I felt, were not strung together convincingly. There's atleast a dozen obvious ones - visiting his homeland after so long, realizing the situation is building up towards something unpleasant not to mention everything as he knew it has changed already, pent-up emotions, unrequited love, decisions to make about fight or flight, the guilt that comes with it, religious faith etc. All these bubbles just hang in mid air, not being dealt with in full and therefore not weaving together a landscape you'd want to explore and understand. (I wonder if this is because of the translation.). 4. Speaking of landscapes, the use of snow, beginning with the title and as a backdrop for the story is a fantastic idea, the umpteen interpretations that can be applied to snow, the metaphors that can be drawn. Sadly, it becomes an overdose after a certain point and quite bland when it becomes repetitive and literal. Something on the lines of 'The snow is beautiful. Did you watch the snow from the window? They are talking about the snow on TV. Hey, did I mention how beautiful the snow falls?' We get it. Its snowing. Why did all those people in the theatre get shot?. Ka catches your attention only in the beginning when he seems like a man of purpose; afterall he is a journalist who is investigating the suicides in the city. But beyond a few chapters he loses track, other characters keep flitting in and out, each with veiled romantic notions and opinions of their own that you don't know fact from fiction anymore. It is as if, Ka, your tour guide for the journey disappeared down a snowed-in road leaving you in the midst of hawkers who're swarming around trying to sell you souvenirs, you who don't speak the language or know your way around. You call after him but he just leaves you with a parting comment - The snow is beautiful. Did I mention it is snowing? You just stare at him as you pull your layers closer and brush off a fleck of white from the end of your nose.. Maybe I'll find the patience to finish this one some other time."
11/04/2021,b2,r642,23826312,Nina,"Mar 19, 2016",4,"This book was more subtle than most in my rotation, leaving me uncertain until almost the end about whether I was following the author’s intentions or artificially superimposing my own [Western, Millennial, Progressive] values and interpretations. It was like trying on a garment and not being able to tell if the fit was off because the design is poor, I picked up the wrong size, or the garment fits the way it’s supposed to but the look is just not one I think of as flattering. AKA – is the problem Orhan Pamuk? Is it me – am I just not getting it? Or are we looking at cross-cultural differences – am I negatively judging a character for behavior that the author meant to be inoffensive?. Spoiler: the answer is (d) none of the above. 77 pages before the end, Pamuk finally owns up that he’s been messing with the reader’s head purposefully: “. For the first time since his arrival in Kars, Ka felt the peace of righteousness: At long last, the villain was talking like a villain, saying all the vicious things that villains say, and this cleared his head.. ”. This novel works very hard to avoid all the tropes, key words, and stereotyped behaviors that we rely on to get our bearings with regards to strangers and new characters. We lean on those tropes to determine relatively quickly whether someone is good, bad, interesting, selfish, naïve, etc. Scrubbed of those tropes, Pamuk’s world is disorienting – can I trust my narrator? Who’s the good guy? She’s clearly holding something back – does that make her forlorn and heartrending or potentially threatening? The goal is to force the reader to encounter the characters in their full humanness, without pre-judging them based on dogma or creed. Kind of like in real life: we never think of ourselves as villains, nor would we describe ourselves that way to another. Absent the dead giveaways like maniacal laughs or threatening monologues, what makes someone a villain? Given that “Snow” takes place in Eastern Turkey and the characters include an underground terrorist, fundamentalist muslim youth, an authoritarian semi-fascist coup leader, a police state comfortable with torture, ex-Communists, and Westernized political exiles, the fact that I couldn’t be comfortable in my character judgments is a major achievement on Pamuk’s part.. Since 9/11, we Westerners have been exposed to political postulating about fundamentalist Islam, terrorism, theocracies, and authoritarian responses – these are the issues that elections are run on, these are the issues over which we go to war. However, in the last scene in “Snow,” the author asks one of the characters whether he has a message to pass on to the novel’s [presumably Western and/or cosmopolitan] readers. The character replies that “. No one could understand us from so far away.. ” Indeed.. So I need to read it again.. Follow up:. this. is a great review. Ignore the ""spoiler"" rating, go ahead and read it. Among other insights, the review acknowledges that the quality of the book is not correlated to whether you'd be interested in having a beer with the narrator. Who may or may not be as infuriatingly anxty and self-involved as Hamlet."
11/04/2021,b2,r643,23818026,Kshitiz Goliya,"Oct 12, 2016",4,"Everything has politics, my professor once told me. While reading Snow, I realized the true value of that statement.. Turkey has always been torn between Islamists and military backed secularists. The recent coup attempt was in line with many that preceded it.. Whenever an Islamist party becomes powerful and thus tries to project Islam more forcefully, there is a section that lashes back, albeit through non-democratic means.. The tolerance for coups in some parts of Turkish society has made sure that they are still an option resorted to by military, whenever it feels the government of the day is diverging from the unwritten principles of Ataturk.. Snow is the story of a poet, Ka, who returns to Turkey from his exile in Germany and goes to a small town, Kars. Behind his trip was hidden the desire to see a woman named Ipek whom he secretly loved during his student days and who later married and subsequently divorced his other friend.. He masquerades as a journalist on assignment and enters Kars amidst a snowy winter at its full might. His supposed focus of inquiry is the suicide girls. These girls, for reasons that Ka tried finding but could never be clear, gave up their lives in quick successions. The act alarmed the society and brought the focus of elite press from the capital.. With suicide being a crime in Islam, were these women, who were generally suppressed in Islam, using suicide as an act of defiance? Or was it out of pure desperation and despair?. It didn't matter after some time as Ka started to get pulled into the town's life and contradictions.. Soon he met the women he had deeply and secretly loved, which combined with conflict in the city, brought within him a swell of thoughts that opened the way for some of his best poems.. Islam and atheism, communist and Islamist, love and betrayal; he had to deal with all these extremes during his stay in Kars and still he was happiest for Ipek requited his love.. At the same time, he saw an old man being shot closely followed by a successful local coup attempt, each event pulling him deeper into the whirlwind of city's politics and the associated conspiracies.. Ka, like every human, cherished the secret longings of happiness and imagined it to be in a married life with Ipek. He saw it in both of them walking down the streets of Berlin, away from the tumult of Turkey.. Ka constantly took refuge in the beauty of snow, in its constant and gradual descent as well as pure whiteness.. However, at the back of his mind was always a fear that happiness will slip out of his fingers and melt like the constantly falling snow flakes in the streets of Kars.. He soon realized that happiness is like a snow flake, beautiful and pure, but equally fragile, ready to disappear as soon as it is within grasp.. The secret police within the city, on the lines of Stasi and KGB, closely followed Ka with its spies and bugs all over the town. He ends up running against them, out of his love for Ipek and encounters certain truths that shatter his dream of a happy married life in Berlin.. Ultimately, as the winter recedes and snow melts, so does his dreams of happiness. He leaves Kars alone in the train, Ipek left behind. Happiness for him was short lived."
11/04/2021,b2,r644,62355451,Mohammad Wasil,"Jan 03, 2019",4,"Cold, alone and blue, love, politic, mystery.... This novel drove me to those situations."
11/04/2021,b2,r645,140203,Brian,"Jun 01, 2008",4,"Poetically political, this novel focuses on the rather current debate in modern Turkey over whether to be more Western or to be more Eastern. Choosing the former means progress, democracy, ""freedom"", etc., but at the potential loss of a national identity rooted in cultural/religious ties to the Islamic world. The stage for the debate is the remote city of Kars, which is about to be isolated from the rest of the country by an oncoming snowstorm. Enter the poet Ka, who comes to Kars ostensibly to investigate the phenomenon of Islamic university women committing suicide for having to remove their headscarves in order to attend the univesities, but whose reasons for staying quickly turn purely romantic and nostalgic. Indeed, snow to him has a powerfully romantic and nostalgic effect, while for everyone else it is simply a nuisance; for, when a coup suddenly takes place during a play at a theater (art and politics blend continually throughout the novel), the city is unable to receive any help from the national government due to the heavy snowfall.. While snow has significant poetical meaning for Ka, which the narrator explains in detail in several chapters, it really functions in the book as a metaphor of fate. For snow can fall gently and beautifully, and be wonderful to watch or dance or play in, or it can fall forcibly, and quite limit one's scope of activity. The more political the characters are, the less they appreciate the snow; these characters seek to control the course of events, and the snowfall prevents them from doing so. The less political (and really this only means Ka plus a few others to a certain extent), the more snow is just a part of life; something that can be looked at beautifully if one is not seeking to control the natural course of events for one's own purposes.. Thus does the story seem to suggest (albeit very slightly, kind of like the falling of snow) that, to some extent or another, the course of historical events is really outside of any one individual or one group's control; there is always something more powerful at work. These individuals and groups certainly play a role (as in a play--solutions to political problems are sought out twice in the form of a play in this novel) in the shaping of that history, but it is not really they who shape history; history shapes them.. Will Turkey become more Eastern or Western? That question almost seems pushed aside by the larger question of how the answering of that question will affect the players involved. Will they be like the young, politically-charged characters, whose lives end abruptly either by their own hand or by someone else's? Or will they be like Ka, who pursues a more personal beauty in life, who stands by and watches the natural course of change in his country, seeking to capture it in verse, who only becomes incidentally involved in the political events by his pursuit of love (of which he is bereft by those same political events).. This is truly a complicated novel, and yet its themes and ideas are tied together so intricately and delicately; rather like a snowflake."
11/04/2021,b2,r646,75617629,Christabel Terence,"Dec 31, 2018",4,"A novel on religion, identity and happiness, one that shines in its multiple perspective approach to secularism, Islam and the West. A fast-moving and engrossing novel of intellectual depth that may disappoint slightly in its final few chapters."
11/04/2021,b2,r647,9281934,Louise,"Dec 28, 2014",5,"Ka, a visitor to his rural and poor hometown of Kars in Turkey, is sought after by many for his presumed access to the German (""European""/""Western"") press. He is also protected by this and while he will be questioned, he will not be tortured.. His position, as a possible conduit to an outside world, reveals the contradictions within the characters. Political Islam is their proxy for inferiority and other complex emotions about ""The West"". (One young man dreams of eating well on the lap of a blonde western woman). The headscarf is a symbol of solidarity... and a powerful symbol it is in Kars. The town is gripped by the tension and drama surrounding a prominent woman's potential removal of her scarf (will she or won't she?) and to a lesser degree by the question of who killed the administrator of the local university tasked by ""Istambul"" with enforcing the ban on headscarves.. Ka says he is investigating the suicides of the ""headscarf girls"", who are the real victims of this political culture, for a story in a German periodical. While Islamists ponitificate on the pitiable piety of the suicide girls, Ka finds other motives. These motives show a paternal willingness to marry off, abuse or otherwise sacrifice their daughters that reflects the same attitude that pressures them to wear the scarves. The sad situation of the girls, caught between their desire for an education, their need to belong and their families' desire to control them is never expressed by the girls (except by their suicides)... only by those who presume to speak for them.. In ""Red"" the characters introduce themselves through their first person chapters. Here, in a similar technique characters disclose themselves through first person dialog in which they reveal their personal conflicts, ambivalences and often a sense of defeatism.. The book is written in a different first person, but there is only a hint of this in the beginning. I'm glad Pamuk resisted the temptation to give us intricate folk tales nested inside the stories as he did in ""Red"".. This is a beautifully crafted portrait. While it defines a specific culture in rural Turkey, there is a wider metaphor for social groups left behind.I hope this book finds its way to academic reading lists. It deserves a wide and thoughtful audience.. It's like ""Red"", is a warm up for ""Snow"". I hope ""Snow"" is another warm up for more and equally powerful literature by Pamuk."
11/04/2021,b2,r648,40489794,Jo-Lynne Lockley,"Dec 10, 2015",3,"Nobel Prize winner Orham Pamuk describes the complexities of European / Islamic relations and perceptions through the character of once exiled middling journalist and poet Ka who finds himself snowed-in in the once grand and now deteriorating Turkish city of Kars. Ka, who has been sent there by a Turkish paper published in Germany to cover suicides apparently connected to a debate over banning head scarves and who carries memories of a woman from the days of his rational youthful political involvement, finds himself caught in an inescapable crucible where Eastern fundamentalist misperceptions and misguided and ham handed government attempts to hold a backwater to the urban secular state colide in a bizarre conflagration of art or at least the artistic ego pretending to art meets politics and military force. The resulting total collapse of rational and civil society in a farsical political military artistic microcosm brings out the worst in Ka, whose whose hitherto writers block constipated poetry begins to flow with neither restraint nor reflection due, as he feels, alternately to the snow or the beautiful Ipek as muse. As Ka's artistic delusions and infatuation with Ipek increase his moral compass fails, so that his self interested actions lead to the loss of his dreams and not a few deaths. A thread of Ka's inner conflict between the rational secularism he has embraced all his life, the enthrallment with Islam thread through the entertainly absurd tale without informing his actions or decisions.. The characters with whom Pamuk populates the story are magnificent cartoons of the worlds of political military intrigue and pseudo art, which acts as a justification for the barbary into which Ka allows himself to be drawn.. The language is straight forward and hardly lyrical. It's in translation, after all. I find it hard to see the book as a satire, although it paints a persiflage of political / religious fanatics, madmen and expedient remoras. It is funny. Or at least amusing. Only after putting the book down and letting the managerie and chaos settle does one sense that the situation Pamuk creates is hysterical, but hardly to laugh at.. Pamuk foreshadows the turning points and end of the novel well before he relates actual events, making it less of a page turner (it still is...knowing what happened one is eager to see how it happened).. For me it had the feel of the illegitimate child of Death in Venice and Wag the Dog..not a bad thing, all in all."

He weaved a fascinating tale. The pursuit of happiness always just out of reach and ultimately never realized..... ""People don't know when they're happy, at least not at the moment. I decided years later that I'd been happy as a child, but the truth is, I wasn't. On the other hand, I was not unhappy in the way I was during the years that followed. I just wasn't interested in happiness at first."" 285. ""All over the world - even in America - the newspapers tailor the news to their readers' desires.

""Life's not about principles, it's about happiness."" 338. ""People who seek only happiness never find it."" Blue to Ka, 379. ""I'm almost certain something terrible's about to happen. Why? Because I'm so happy. I can't say how or where they came from, but since coming to Kars I've written eighteen poems. One more and I'll have written and entire volume, or perhaps I should say it will have written itself. I believe what you say about wanting to go back to Frankfurt with me, and I can see an even greater happiness stretching out before us. It just seems dangerous to be this happy. That's how I know something terrible is going to happen."" Ka and Ipek, 399"
11/04/2021,b2,r650,2609937,Lynne Norman,"Oct 09, 2010",2,"I honestly don't know where to start with my review of this novel. I suppose I can begin by saying that I didn't like it - despite the fact I really, really wanted to. The only problem is I find it hard to put my finger on why I didn't like it - as I generally relish reading post-modern writing, such as this, where it is less about the novel's narrative arc than it is about the many layers and themes. It frustrates me that I didn't like this book - because I then feel as though I must have missed something, and I don't like the feeling that maybe I just didn't 'get' it.. Perhaps it was the protagonist himself - Ka - that turned me off? He is a very immature and selfish individual, with borderline sociopathic tendencies. I believe the reader was supposed to see him as a naive and pure artist, perhaps, but instead I found him cold and one dimensional. Maybe it was the cast list as a whole that I found problematical - consisting, as it did, of many one-dimensional people, who never seemed to react to events or conversations in the way that normal, and therefore complex, human beings would (Maybe that was the point? Who knows? Not me). It could have been the representation of women as there wasn't one strong female character I could identify with - again, as this is a book narrated from a male perspective, this could have been a commentary on how Turkish women are viewed by the men around them - but it's not a clearly made comment if that's the case.. On the positive side, Pamuk's prose is on occasion beautiful and he does a very good job of conjuring up a sense of place and atmosphere. It's enough to make me a little sad that not one of the poems written by Ka through this tale makes an appearance in the book. That said, I do understand that, again, that's kind of the point - the poems represent the key to understanding another human being's psyche (in this instance, the narrator Orhan Pamuk's understanding of his lost friend Ka) and the failure to unearth these poems speaks to the fact we can never truly understand the people we are close to (or at least I think that's what it represents!).. I think it speaks volumes that the reviews for this book tend to swing widely from love to hate. Unfortunately, I definitely tend towards the latter."
11/04/2021,b2,r651,4007077,Sarahlynn,"May 06, 2011",2,"My apologies for the erratic weather we've had so far this year. I recently realized that it's all my fault.. See, in December a friend gave me a novel called Snow by Turkish author Orhan Pamuk. As I read it in fits and starts, it took me a really really long time to finish. But I'm finally done! And so now the snow can stop and spring can commence in earnest.. You're welcome.. As for why it took me so long to finish this book, well, that's all me I suppose. I kept flipping back to the front cover to verify that the seal on the front proclaiming, ""Winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature!"" was still there and not just something I dreamed.. Later, I'd turn the book over and peruse the blurbs again. ""One of the best books of the year"" according to just about everyone from The New York Times Book Review to The Economist. Rave reviews from truly impressive people.. Repeatedly I read the jacket copy. ""Slyly comic."" Also, ""humor,"" ""wicked grin,"" etc.. I was excited to read this fabulous book, which came so highly recommended and is set in Turkey. (My in-laws lived in Turkey for years and my husband was actually born there; they returned to the states when his sister was ready for elementary school.). But I just didn't get it. I didn't engage with the story, I didn't connect with the characters, and I felt frustrated by the pace. (The first day seemed to me like it must have been at least 48 hours long. Is Ka really in his late 30's as it appears? If so, how come the 17+ year age difference between close sisters Ipek and Kadife is never discussed?) I utterly missed the humor.. Obviously, this is all on me since apparently everyone else who's read Snow loved it. But I spent the first 200 pages trying to figure out why the author gave most of the unrelated main characters the same last name (Bey). Then I figured it must be a subtle comment on the provincial nature of Turkish society (the cerebral humor I'd been missing?). By page 300 I'd realized that ""Bey"" must be a sort of honorific (and it is). Some of my confusion might indeed have been cultural. I certainly feel like an uncultured ignoramus for my utter failure to appreciate this highly acclaimed novel.. But I finished it, and now it's spring!"
11/04/2021,b2,r652,17248131,Michael Battaglia,"Jul 28, 2018",5,"In keeping with the ""themes without really trying"" theme, I apparently to arrange to read three books about a fictional present day version of the Ottoman Empire and then right afterwards read a book about what the Ottoman Empire later evolved into today. That . . . wasn't intentional.. But while Grimwood's trilogy was set in a present day version of Alexandria, Egypt, Pamuk's book is set in Turkey itself. Weirdly, both involve investigating deaths but while one is attempting to do a SF noir, Pamuk is going for something a bit more in depth, even if his also features two people who should be together but refuse to be for a variety of excuses.. For those who have never encountered him, Pamuk is a Turkish novelist and probably the best known Turkish writer outside of Turkey, having won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2006. Having made a name for himself internationally with ""My Name is Red"", this was the follow up novel (and I think his second published in English) and both on some level deal with tensions between the East and West, here highlighted by the poet Ka, who is an expat living in Frankfurt, Germany for years and who travels to the Turkish border city of Kars in a journalistic capacity to investigate a spate of suicides of young girls. The word is they killed themselves rather than be forced to remove their headscarves, something that might strike a person as a somewhat frivilous reason to kill yourself. But spend a little time in the ""Context is Everything"" department and you get an idea how meaningful the issue is to people. At the time of Turkey's founding it was considered a secular state and thus the wearing of headscarves was discouraged, later on becoming outright banned in public places after around 1980. For a country with a devout Muslim population this didn't always sit well and in the case of the students in the novel it was banned at all schools and unversities, leading to the protests discussed before the action in the novel starts. Its a debate that still goes on today, as Turkey's current prime minister campaigned on it although Turkey's high court seems to have put the kibosh on any attempts to lift it as recently as 2008.. Needless to say, its not a trifling issue to the people in the novel and as Ka enters the city just as its cut off by a massive snowstorm, you figure either one of two things will happen . . . Lovecraftian monsters will emerge from the blizzard or a whole lot of life-altering drama is about to happen. As it turns out, Ka probably should have wished for Cthulu.. His initial reason for going as a journalist falls apart pretty quickly as his early rounds of questioning don't get him much of anywhere but fortunately his backup reason is fairly compelling as well . . . an opportunity to start fresh with a woman he used to be in love with, now recently divorced. Trapped in the city adn staying at her father's hotel, all Ka can hear is Bad Company's greatest hit playing on constant repeat in his head, alternating with a rush of poems that have to do with being trapped in a city where no one seems to like him or each other, and often express that through long debates or by firing guns. Sometimes, for variety, its both.. Its a very dreamlike novel at times, trapped in a strange kind of stasis as everyone runs around making their arguments while the snow constantly falls and political conditions take a strong swing toward ""armed insurrection"". Having been away for a while and living in Germany Ka is seen as a Westerner, something that everyone loves reminding him about as often as they can and highlighting probably Ka's biggest stumbling block (and maybe ours) in trying to salvage anything he can out of this situation . . . he just doesn't understand these people.. Its that lack of understanding that underlies almost every bad decision he makes, intentionally or otherwise. Faced with a variety of nationalist, Islamic and secular factions, all of whom have pretty strong ideas on how things should be done, Ka tries to thread a needle with the kind of rope that docks a ship and gets the kinds of results you'd expect. It doesn't help that almost everyone is okay with a body count . . . an early murder happens quickly before Pamuk takes us back to the excruciating discussion beforehand, all the time the outcome hanging about in the back of our heads. A later massacre is horrifying in how it feels like a dream and how pointless it seems, with soldiers firing on a crowd and us being warned who will die before the bullets hit. As it goes on, everyone is sure they're right but it seems the ones willing to go the furthest will be the ones to carry the day, at least until the snow clears and the local authorities restore order.. Its a postmodern novel, which means it can be a bit emotionally chilly at times . . . Ka and Ipek's rekindling of their relationship can be touching but there's always a bit of distance in everyone's feelings, like the cold from the snow has made everyone a little bit numb. Ka as a main character isn't the most dynamic force, once the suicide investigation falls off the map so does almost all his momentum for driving the plot and from then he's carried by events when he's not wooing Ipek to the point where you almost want to ask the guy to get a room inside his room. Also, just for giggles, Pamuk places himself as the narrator doing his own investigation of Ka's life before and after the events in Kars, which means sometimes the narrative stops or changes shape as we're given access to events that Ka doens't know about yet or details about what later happens to him and the other characters.. It makes for a novel that probably has the same snowflake structure of Ka's lost book of poems, one where all the delicate places are connected but only last as long as the storm holds out. People hoping to see a ride through the underbelly of a town's political and religious frictions may be a little disappointed how much of the back portions of the book are given to preparation for a provocative play but its what happens around those preparations that makes the novel finally frost over. We're never given the resolution to some of the mysteries in the story but that only seems fitting. What the novel seems to be best trying to figure out is how to understand each other, how our points of view can coexist even when those points don't seem to include other people, how a simple piece of clothing or its removal can mean the world to someone. Ka goes home to a foreign country, from a place that everyone treats like another planet and in the end the only way to understand is by imposing your own filters to make the differences digestible, which isn't really understanding at all. And maybe the ones who really get it are those able to articulate that disconnect but unfortunately no one probably understands them either."

So every now and then I could gaze out the window just like Ka.. Other than that I have to admit I was a bit disappointed. I had first heard of this author when I was remotely involved with a European Young Readers' Award ceremony - My Name is Red was one of the six books shortlisted for the prize. I had ordered all six, but Pamuk's book did not arrive before the meeting so I didn't get to read it ahead of time. Later I tried to send it down to our country place to read at some point on holiday, but it was stolen out of our car (with about twenty-five other TBRs!!) while the car was parked waiting for the ferry. So I haven't read that one which I was very intrigued by. When I saw this offered as a bookcrossing ring, I signed up right away.. At times I very much enjoyed this, but after a while felt like I was looking into a mirror across from a mirror and the multiple reflections were dizzying in the long run. There was a certain amount of poetry, but when I tried to discern a piece of writing I found really moving or beautiful, I could never quite put my finger on anything - like trying to hold onto a snowflake - at the end my fingers were just wet, but there was nothing I could really say, ""yes, this I really like."" I could not identify with the characters, neither male nor female - the constant pessimism of the hero was wearying,the women seemed calculating and one dimensional. Knowing ahead of time so much of what would happen was an interesting approach, but it added to the mirror within mirror effect.. Looking out at the snow falling as I write this, I can say I did enjoy the descriptions of the snow and the feeling of isolation. I was glad of the opportunity to read this."
11/04/2021,b2,r654,9846419,george,"May 28, 2012",3,"A touching exploration of a character's quest to find his identity, and how his desires (and the acquisition of those desires) reveal what it is be human. Pamuk's use of duality (or even sometimes three's) with both the novel's characters, its form and reality itself (the novel regularly question's the implication of art in life, and art and reality's inter-changeability) is used skilfully, although at times it does seem to attenuate the narrative, or at least creates an representational ambiguity that perhaps lessen's the emotional impact of certain scenes. However, this is more the case with the inclusion of the dual-protagonist (and meta-narratorial author-within-the-novel) than it is with other characters, and other concepts that are explored.. The novel is strongest when it's at its most subjective, particularly exploring Ka's inner conflicts about love, happiness, and how that is represented by the physicality of movement and stasis. Although Pamuk could be accused of telling rather than showing, particularly at the end of the novel, the exploration of what literature and art represents (although at times narratively facile) is very interesting, and emphasises the difficulty of representing a particular culture without subjectifying it, or, as Fazil deliberates, sentimentalising 'the other' within a narrative that ultimately creates an undermining sense of pity. Rather than forcing us to feel a pervading emotion, Pamuk handles it delicately so that we appreciate the difference of another culture while embracing the universality of the emotional conflicts the characters feel."
11/04/2021,b2,r655,4308977,Vera Sophia,"Sep 23, 2014",4,"As a woman who is also a muslim I am deeply drawn to the theme of this novel. The conflict between East v.s West, the struggle of identity, the unnecessary politicization of our religion and of course the obsession on what women should wear or not wear on their heads, are all too familiar. The issues of (muslim) women discussed in this book like the need to have a say on the control of our bodies, how we are turned into pawns in political game, really resonate with me. It is also fascinating to read about the characters which could easily be seen as one-dimensional in a more humanistic light, the handsome Islamist Blue who I can't really decide to hate nor like, Kadife who wears veil as an act of rebellion, or Necip the religious student who is bordering on atheism. Like all Pamuk's books, Snow posseses a distinct melancholic feeling which I love. With a sprinkle of (tragic) romance it is almost a perfect book for me.. I would end this review with a passage from the end of the book:. 'If you write a book set in Kars and put me in it, I'd like to tell your readers not to believe anything you say about me, anything you say about any of us. No one could understand us from so far away'. ...'If only to see themselves as wise and superior and humanistic, they need to think of us as sweet and funny, and convince themselves that they sympathise with the way we are and even love us. But if you would put in what I've just said, at least your readers will keep a little room for doubt in their minds.'. Thank you for another beautiful ending Mr. Pamuk, also for reminding me not to be a know-it-all judgemental person."
11/04/2021,b2,r656,9271767,Kathryn,"Dec 02, 2012",5,"I read Snow very, very slowly--I took more than a month to read it-- and that rate felt appropriate. It wasn't gripping; it wasn't exciting. It was so beautiful, however, and sad, so very sad. I wept so many times while reading it, and always publicly. The political parts are interesting, and I felt like the discussions among community members about what it means to be Western and how they felt themselves observed (or not) by the West seemed so intelligent and unnervingly and bluntly insightful. This was not what made it a great book, though. For me, it was great because of the tremendous and yet understated portrait it provided of love, profound loneliness, loss, and disappointment. None of it was on a large scale-- there was no passion or intense, colorful scenes. Instead, it was small but incredibly deep and raw. You penetrate so deeply into one man's heart during a period when all of his chances for happiness and love hinge on one person. He knows, though, that his brief episode of happiness will not last, that it cannot last, and you know this, too. Devastation is inevitable and so painful to witness. And yet, you feel such compassion (co-suffering) for him, Ka, and for everyone who loves despite the incredible pain involved (all of us, I think). And that experience of compassion, for Ka, for oneself, and for everyone else, I don't know, somehow reminds you of fundamental truths about human nature and what being human is all about. Beauty and suffering, the heights and the depths. I loved this book."
11/04/2021,b2,r657,32635507,Rex,"Apr 03, 2015",5,"I've been to Kars only for a short time, and in late spring, when yellow flowers are everywhere, so it is difficult for me to relate the winter atmosphere of this novel to the quiet but lovely part of eastern Turkey I encountered in person. Nevertheless, I think I will enjoy. Snow. more on every reread. It is absorbing and introspective, sentimental and political, vivid in its presentation of people thrown into the mad (and sometimes literal) theater of a local coup. For Pamuk, Kars, with its poverty and isolation, its provincial jealousies, its resentment at being alternately ignored and pitied by the world, is transfigured by the falling snow into a magical city where love and religion alike are quickly gained and quickly lost, where dreams of romantic or political glory are seemingly allowed to blossom before being exposed as ephemera under the cruel light of the sun. Those who die linger as ghosts of desire in the souls of those who were close to them. Pamuk's neurotic protagonist conscientiously entertains both the beckoning visions of the snow and a clinging drive toward self-destruction; the novel, likewise, teeters between hope and fatalism. Can a life have meaning, or are we stuck in the ""Place Where God Does Not Exist,"" as a young Islamist puts it, hungry wights longing vainly for happiness? Perhaps, paradoxically, the sorrow and alienation and disappointment that come as the snow melts, when we realize we are actors in a play not of our choosing, might enable us to find and truly live in one another."
11/04/2021,b2,r658,137418,William,"Jun 21, 2007",5,"There is no real reason to link Snow to. The Lovers of Algeria. or. The Swallows of Kabul. , two Muslim-authored books I read earlier this year, other than a personal effort to understand better the religion our President seems to be at war against. But of these three novels, which all deal with the leaps in power given to Islamic fundamentalists over the past thirty years, Snow seems the most Western-feeling of the three. Maybe that’s a given for a novel about Turkey, the most Westernized of Mediterranean Muslim nations, and for a book whose author was awarded a prize from that most prestigious Western literary institution.. What I. liked. about Snow was its Western feel, which seemed to allow me in a bit more (an attitude with political problems). The scope, too, is broad and detailed and full of interesting characters who are all perfectly understandable as individuals.. When you read a book that is so obviously good, it seems silly to go on about it so much. So I’ll just say (until perhaps I can think of something more original to add) that I enjoyed getting into this author’s world, and will probably read more of it soon."
11/04/2021,b2,r659,34121152,Soren,"Feb 10, 2016",4,"The first 150 pages or so of this book are really moving and beautifully written. I felt sucked into a mystical slipstream of natural beauty, somber contemplation, and the sense that life's direction, while baffling, is somehow driven. The rest of the book is less powerful and more chaotic, yet at the end I was left with the sense of having experienced something profound. Also, Fazil's meta-statement to the book's audience on the last page is a powerful warning about how we may have been misreading the book.. It was Margaret Atwood's review (Headscarves to Die For) that pushed me over the edge of indecision to finally read this book, and I set out hoping to gain some insight into the conflict between conservative Islamism and Western values. To any who read with similar motivation, I say: if you want analysis and talking points, go read an essay or a history book; however, if you want to be left with a profound FEELING of the tension, this book is exactly what you should read.. If you expect a linear plot with a clear, neat message, you will be disappointed. But if you are ready for a winding journey that is both beautiful and frustrating, this book is definitely worth reading."
11/04/2021,b2,r660,18170516,Parth Seth,"Dec 12, 2019",4,"""People who seek only happiness never find it."". This book served as my introduction to the world of Orhan Pamuk. I was going through a reading slump of late due to reasons I deem best not to share on this platform. This wonderful book by Orhan Pamuk, translated by Maureen Freely, helped me come out of it.. The book opens with the bus journey of the main protagonist called Ka from Erzurum to Kars(though his real name was Kerim Alakuşoğlu). Being a political exile in Frankfurt, he had returned to his country, ostensibly, for his mother's funeral, and to cover the municipal elections of the city of Kars which had been caught in a suicide epidemic raging among its young women. However, his intention was to reconnect with the beautiful İpek Hanım, a lady divorced to his college-mate Muhtar who was poised for a victory in the elections. The plot then turns to a coup de'etat in the garb of a coup de theatre by a visiting theatre group. The entire novel spans three days of the coup, and how Ka became embroiled in the insanity of boundless love, intrigue, politics, religion, and deceit.. The author lays bare the dichotomy between the East and the West which plays out in the minds of common people and their perceptions. I think the novel is a study in perceptions of the 'technological' West and the 'mystical' East—the latter taking steps towards donning a fabric woven by the West. These perceptions breed hatred and misunderstanding, the effects of which can be seen today in the didactic lectures given by leaders on the shortcomings of Western culture, and of the stagnancy of the East. This theme is profound in virtually all of Pamuk's works, and has allowed him to carve a distinct space for himself in Postmodern literature.. The novel elucidates the omnipresent identity struggle in Ka's mind. On one hand, he is closely tied to his leftist, revolutionary ideals of liberty and individualism. On the other hand, he is disillusioned with his ideals because they have reaped him nothing. He is far removed from the grassroots of his country and terribly fails to understand their conflicts. His life in Frankfurt is underscored by melancholy, a longing for İpek, poet's block, loneliness, and grief. The atmosphere of Kars, the honesty of its natives like Necip, and closeness with İpek sends him to summits of happiness. He accomplishes to write an entire volume of poetry and rekindles something called hope: a hope for a happy life with İpek in Frankfurt.. Even though the novel was penned in 2004, its theme revolving around religion is as pertinent in contemporary Turkey and the Orient. The author cleverly juxtaposes the everyday struggles of the simpletons, their abject poverty, and hopelessness, with their constant struggle against the imposition of godlessness and atheism. Having read Orhan's personal opinion on religion and religious politics, I can safely say that he doesn't let them come in between the narrative; he gives as much space to the Kemalists and leftists like Turgut Bey, as he does to the Islamists like Blue and the high school boys. The author, however, passionately highlights that contrary to the opinion of the intolerant atheists, religion is not a reserve of the poor to aid them to escape the bitter realities of their life. Instead, it is followed with equal enthusiasm and held close to the soul by the educated and forward-looking sections of the society as well. By showcasing the conflict between the Islamists and the Kemalists, the author gives abundant food for thought to the readers so that they form an independent opinion on this stand.. I could identify with the philosophical discourse on happiness that underscored Ka's visit to Turkey. He'd, after all, gone there to find the happiness he may never have known but had always desired. Ka is painted as an individual who is simultaneously desirous of, and insular to, happiness. Even when happiness knocks at his doors, he hunts for some excuse to turn it away, lest its end bring about greater sadness than what prevailed in the present. Huzun, that is, melancholy is a dominant theme of Orhan Pamuk's novels. It is this melancholy which reprises at different junctures of the story. Ka's destiny conspires to keep him in the throngs of melancholy. He is showcased to be lonely and depressed to such an extent that unhappiness imparted a strange sort of relaxation to him. Ka's happiness led him to be a believer, and also helped him to come out of his poet's block. For the author, happiness lay in objects external to Ka– be it the obsession with İpek or the bonding with Necip. Probably it was his inability to find happiness within that made Ka hopelessly and resolutely sad.. In the concluding chapters of the novel, the narrator also brings to the fore his friendship with Ka. His friendship made him hunt for his friend's lost notebook of poems and takes him all the way to Kars. In Kars, he himself can't help feeling helplessly attracted to İpek. I think at this point the narrative became a bit unstructured. Suddenly, his brotherly sensitivity to Ka assumed the form of jealousy. He leaves the readers confused over his own feelings towards Ka. Was he a jealous friend in love with İpek, or a realistic man who saw the error of his friend's ways and could find no reason to showcase his innocence? The author could not logically explain how the issue of the headscarf girls– which was the underlying theme of the story– gets overpowered by Ka's obsession with making ploys for a happy life with İpek and convincing her, only to surface at the end of the story.. All things considered, the book was an amazing page-turner. Its philosophical concerns were highly relatable. Touching on a variety of themes in politics, religion, culture, love, and friendship(of which I have touched upon a few), it promises to be on the bookshelves of a diverse set of people. The author effortlessly builds unforgettable and deep characters. I highly recommend this novel, and hope that it goes on to become a classic in postmodern literature."
11/04/2021,b3,r961,10236850,Jo,"Feb 01, 2016",5,"This is an incredible book. I have to say I nearly lost patience with it at times, but I'm so glad I finished it. (Alert: spoilers ahead!). The story takes us through the life of a rich Turkish man in his 30s, who has apparently everything: money, friends, a beautiful fiance and all the advantages that come with being part of Istambul's elite. And then one day he steps into a shop and recognizes a distant relation in the shopkeeper. And everything changes.. There are so many stages of life and love and emotion in this book: elation, passion, despair, and also the stillness (and boredom) of routine. Love to Kemal is an obsession that he feeds constantly not only by noticing the most intricate details of his loved one's complexion and personality, but also by compulsively collecting everything around her, everything that reminds him of her and of a particular time and place when they were in love. As you go through his journey, there is a point at which you think he's just creepy and crazy. And then, in the end, you somehow understand him. It is one of those books that becomes whole as you read its final line. It all makes sense and you cannot help but wonder at how creative and different from everything else you've read it really is. Cannot recommend it enough."

I thought about what draws me to choose the books I read; I'm hoping to encounter three-dimensional and complex characters and settings that surround me. And on these two criteria, this novel excels.. Not that it doesn't take some patience. Kemal, as protagonist and narrator, defines all-consuming obsession. It is confounding, and almost beyond suspension of disbelief, that the many characters around him enable this obsession,and how (until the end) he bears very few repercussions for his actions or the lives he impairs. But in the end, I was willing to accept as credible the unhealthy dynamics that cut across family and friends. There are many, many complexities here, and seemingly many, many motives across characters. It would be too simplistic to shrug this off as a simple story of one man's obsession, and to thereby grow impatient with the litany of Kemal's obsessive actions and thoughts. Granted, it is a story of obsession, but moreover, it is a story of extended family and friendship and culture, and I found it to be wholly engaging."

It was her own form and her own pleasure that most occupied her. She needed my body, my arms, my fingers, my mouth, to find the pleasure spots and potentials of her body, her soft skin. I sorted through my bundle of memories, one by one, distracting myself until these memories would propel me even deeper in the void of the present moment. I discovered to seize upon an object of our common memories. I sometimes convinced myself that I was slowly growing accustomed to her absence. I would usually spend my two hours in the apartment daydreaming in bed, having selected some object charmed with the illusion of radiating the memories of our happiness. I was thinking about her even more obsessively. Time had not faded my memories. Did she really believe that other men could love her as I did. Don’t be afraid of life, Kemal Bay. I longed to run away from this house and these objects that had both healed me and reminded me of my affliction. Our past, our future, and our memories become as one with that moment's ecstatic escalation. Let everyone know, I lived a very happy life"
11/04/2021,b3,r964,5911585,Aditya Patil,"Feb 11, 2016",3,"A book this big takes you through a whirlwind of emotions. I started this book because of the Nobel-winning author and the fact that it was available in the library. It started with moderate pace and very happening storyline. I was immediately hooked. But after a certain stage, I had to put special efforts to read this book. The protagonist's pain and suffering were so intricately detailed that it was mentally exhausting. Kemal the protagonist's lament after his love, which in my opinion, tends to be borderline psychotic, was one of the saddest and most gruelling I have yet read. (Spoiler Alert) After the big middle chunk of the novel, it again becomes interesting, only to be faced with the death of his love. I was literally frustrated at that point. But as I experienced with Hemingway, Great authors have death as their big weapon in every love story they write. No great love story is without death I guess. Anyways, earlier I was going to give it a one or two stars, but with ending like that, it deserves one more star from my end. No judgment though. He's a great author and this rating just says about my experience."
11/04/2021,b3,r965,3908382,Lyazat,"Oct 01, 2016",4,"The story and the plot are really moving. But it would've been much better if it wasn't for the writer's pompous and narcissistic style of writing. The way Orhan Pamuk is exploiting (this word fits here perfectly) the sentimental scenes, the way he distributed the character's lamenting across the novel, the narcissistic narrator's manner at the end - at a certain point all of this started making me unnerved and pushed me off from the novel. To my mind, there is too much of Orhan Pamuk here, but too little of the story itself. I put four stars for the story just out of respect to the character and the confession he made, but not to the writer himself. Besides, the last ""revelatory"" chapter from Orhan Pamuk himself, where he mentions how some characters were asking him not to disclose personal facts in the book (i.e. Sibel), this part seems so cheesy for me, and does not look decent of the writer, as he could've kept the internal confidentiality and not reveal some of the delicate nuances which, perhaps, were not so important for him, but were so for the characters."

What I liked most about this book is that I listened to it as an audio, and enjoyed tremendously all the descriptions of Istanbul in the '70s.( & 80s) I was actually in Istanbul in the '70s so it was delightful to hear the stories about the Istanbul Hilton, the little restaurants, shops, the street scenes and the Bosphorus Sea. There's nothing better than hearing the correct pronunciation of all the words I would absolutely destroy if I tried to pronounce.. So this rich guy falls madly in love with this beautiful poor girl, on the eve of his engagement to a beautiful rich girl. That's the story, but it's set against the backdrop of this lovely and historic old city. This is not a page turner, but it is a lovely touching love story."

Shortly after that, it became really hard for me to trudge through - the narrator, an obsessive, love lorn kleptomaniac, was so self-absorbed and blinded by his ego that I just couldn't stand it. The whole time I kept thinking this book would have been far more interesting if I could get Fusun's version of the story, who throughout the whole book is nothing more than a spectacle, a muse, an object. The last chapter really salvages the book, and I enjoyed it, albeit post the 700-page mark. The writing is beautiful, but I don't think I would recommend this to anyone.. Side note: Investigating about the Museum of Innocence online after I finished reading it also made me appreciate the book more as a work of art and assuaged my feeling of utter disappointment whilst reading it."
11/04/2021,b3,r968,43477226,Todd Stockslager,"Oct 01, 2017",5,"Review title: Love, Space, Time. The Museum of Innocence is a novel about a love story. It is also the catalog of the objects that tell the love story. It is a unique demonstration of the deep equivalence of love, space, and time. It is a novel that in lesser hands would be merely a novelty but is told (and translated from the original Turkish by Maureen Freely) so well that it richly deserves five stars as a classic.. The love story is told in first person retrospective by Kemal Basmaci, beginning his story when he is 30 years old and a wealthy Istanbul businessman engaged to his social peer Sibel. But just weeks before their engagement is celebrated at a lavish society ball, Kemal by chance meets and falls deeply in love with his 18 year old distant cousin Fusun. The straight line of the story proceeds through the way this reciprocated love effects his engagement and Kemal and Fusun's relationship in the context of the traditional class- and gender-conscious society in the Turkey of the mid 1970s when the novel begins. The relationships cycle from peaks of happiness to depths of despair as seen by Kemal and written looking back on these times based on his view of later events from his current position in life.. Along the way, Pamuk begins to inject indications that there is more to the story than the words of Kemal Basmaci. Kemal begins to refer to objects ""which you can see here"" as if he is pointing at things the reader can see, and you begin to realize that the Museum of the title is not just a metaphor, but a reality for Kemal. As we go deeper into the story Kemal begins to describe picking up objects that Fusun owns or touches (even cigarette butts she has smoked!) and describing the exact date and event in which the objects played a part. This is more than just a love story, but yet not the desperation of an obsession. In Chapter 17: My Whole Life depends on You Now, as he describes what he calls ""the happiest moment of my life"" (with over 60 of the 83 chapters remaining), he begins to consider the importance of the objects he is saving:. Anyone remotely interested in the politics of civilization will be aware that museums are the repositories of those things from which Western Civilization derives its wealth of knowledge, allowing it to rule the world, and likewise when the true collector, on whose efforts these museums depend, gathers together his first objects, he almost never asks himself what will be the ultimate fate of his hoard. When their first pieces passed into their hands, the first true collectors . . . initially never recognized these objects for what they were. (p. 73). At this point in his story he did not class himself as a collector, but he was learning the value of his objects.. The power of things inheres in the memories they gather up inside them, and also in the vicissitudes of our imagination, and our memory--of this there is no doubt. . . . . [These objects] remind me of the slow and humble rhythm of the routines that ruled our lives. (p. 324). It is through my reproduction of that enchanted space that museum visitors can wander, as if through Time (p. 355). Rhythms, space, Time. Pamuk has described in three simple words the powerful deep mystery of life, and of the love that makes it endurable and enduring. The concepts come powerfully together in the presence of the objects. I am writing part of this review at the National Historical Museum in Oslo where there is a traveling exhibition of some of the displays that Pamuk built to accompany each chapter. In fact, I had never heard of Pamuk before seeing the exhibit some months before, and read the book to understand the power of the displays (see. my review of the exhibition catalog. which I read after that first visit). On this second visit, carrying the just-finished novel in my hand as I looked up the chapter that went with each case, the objects in the cases took me right to the meaning and impact of the people and events on the page in ways that felt like this wasn't just a novel I had read, but people and places (and objects) that I knew and recognized.. In a way that feels like a perfectly natural piece of the book, Pamuk the author has Kemal the narrator mention the Pamuk family as a prominent Istanbul family, has Orhan invited to the engagement party, and describes him having a dance with Fusun there. This introduction makes sense when we learn that in fact because of Orhan's position in the same social circles and his knowledge of many of the characters Kemal has invited the fictional Orhan to write the catalog for the Museum of Innocence, in the form of a novel, which Orhan decides to write in.... first person retrospective in Kemal's voice! This gives Orhan and Kemal the chance in the last few chapters, as Kemal has now created his fictional museum (which the real Pamuk would later create in Istanbul, part of which I saw in Oslo), to discuss some of the events of the book so that we can learn how much of what we read was shaped through Kemal's eyes and how much through fictional Orhan's pen. In the interest of preserving the power of the unfolding story for the reader, I will give no more plot details.. Finally, the real and the fictional Pamuk explore the meaning of the Museum. ""Real museums are places where Time is transformed into Space,"" (p. 510) the fictional Pamuk writes in Kemal's voice. As Kemal describes to Pamuk the operating principles of the new museum (readers of the book can bring their copy, which will include in the text a facsimile of the museum's ticket, and have the page stamped to get one free entrance), he explains that in this Space ""visitors will lose all sense of Time."" (p. 520).. Love, Space, Time. The essence of life. This is a classic."
11/04/2021,b3,r969,93313303,Mustafa Moiz,"Feb 16, 2019",5,"An incredibly sad novel. I mean this in the best possible sense. It seemed too long, but for the most part this added to the atmosphere of helplessness, longing and waste that the author was trying to put across. It was written in a very relatable way and Orhan Pamuk’s tongue in cheek references to Istanbul high society, including a mention of himself at a dinner party, were very welcome and made this novel more real than if the main character had only been focused on his love. People live their lives, and even when they go to ruin, those lives have facets other than just whatever caused their ruin. The obsessiveness of the novel’s protagonist, or possibly anti-hero, did not mean that he was not still, to some extent, a part of his social group and family, even if he was losing it all in his love. This novel left me feeling very much depressed, but only because it was written so well."
11/04/2021,b3,r970,27649760,Micah Fagre,"May 10, 2020",4,"This is a strange book. I really enjoyed the writing. To be honest, I love the writing. On the other hand I cringed every time the protagonist addressed the readers to talk about his little pet museum. I recognize similar feelings from lovelorn moments in my life, and even the best moments of reciprocal love--the way simple objects take on their own power. That's real.. I know the point is to not be embarrassed and cringe as we share those intimate, even embarrassing moments from our lives. But besides the distraction it caused me every time the protagonist became self-aware to talk about his collection with supposed museum attendees, it was the air of importance and expectation that droves of people, school buses full of kids even, would be going to visit."
11/04/2021,b3,r971,81395904,Nina Keller,"Apr 28, 2018",4,"I hated every minute of reading this book, but then could not stop thinking about it for weeks. The main character is a mysogonistic narcissist, and I despised him throughout his entire telling of his story. I hate him all over again just thinking about this book. Pamuk’s prose is stunning, the character development is extremely effective, and the themes throughout are enduring.. I had the pleasure of visiting the museum that resulted from this book (what a concept!) in Istanbul, and I especially enjoyed the diagram of anatomy with corresponding feelings, and that the butterfly earrings are for sale. The attention to detail is impressive."
11/04/2021,b3,r972,4040350,Nathan Watling,"Jul 13, 2011",4,"An extremely long and detailed account of a man's obsession with a girl. Pamuk's style is both a pro and a con. On one hand it successfully builds the sense of frustration and yearning to enable the reader to empathise with the main character, while on the other, at times, it's slow and drawn out causing actual frustration. It's an interesting insight into life in Turkish society at the time and the descriptions of my favourite parts of Istanbul were another feature. I'd definitely encourage readers to persevere"
11/04/2021,b3,r973,44051545,Sukanya Deb,"Dec 02, 2017",3,"Well...I am exhausted and relieved that I could finish reading this book. After a point I could not handle Kemal's obsession..I am more rational than a romantic I reckon! Relieved, because I did not want to give up in between...as I fell in love with the sight and smell of Istanbul and Kemal's world which OP created for his readers through this book.. This is my 1st OP book, and I am not stopping with this one! His writing transported me to a world of charm, very lyrical in a way. Kemal disappointed me at times...but then not every protagonist is a 'hero'"
11/04/2021,b3,r974,8889261,Manu,"Apr 27, 2012",1,"One of the most stupid, boring and tedious book. It looks like Pamuk doesn't have much to care after the Nobel. His every single book after that is not even close to his previous works. May be he has got some second hand ghost writers for himself. Just threw it in the dustbin, obviously midway. Pathetic book."
11/04/2021,b3,r975,5481595,Catalina,"Oct 26, 2012",4,"Besides the value this book has for contemporary universal literature, the book is a great introspective into the upper class affairs of Turkish society. The way Pamuk masters the literary arts to show one man who is sincere about his obsession and manifests it in a material way. Visiting the museum after you read the book is a recommended thing to do!"
11/04/2021,b3,r976,15741881,Fazackerly Toast,"Feb 07, 2016",5,"I actually think this is wonderful. I started off thinking why is he bothering, hasn't Proust already done this? then I thought maybe it was more like a love letter to Istanbul. then it became more about living an authentic life. anyway it is complex, illuminating and rich. and the exhibition from the Museum of Innocence in Istanbul is in Somerset House now! going to see it at the weekend."

11/04/2021,b3,r978,1427277,Ati,"Jan 10, 2019",4,"It is a fascinating love story, so much that I couldn't stop reading once I started it. It is a good choice for passtime reading. The story happens in Istanbul in a rich family, telling a you a lot about the culture among people of that social class, at that time. I enjoyed reading it."
11/04/2021,b3,r979,32762671,Nuran Ozkam,"Mar 18, 2019",3,"3.5 Stars.. It's a well-written book about memories and emotions rather than plot twists. However, it was a bit unnecessarily long, many chapters and paragraphs could have been omitted without affecting the narrations' consistency."

I read half of it, put it down for about a year, and just picked it a few weeks ago to soldier through the second half. It was really good at times, but most of the time, it just felt really, really long. This is the second book that I've read by Orhan Pamuk. His later book, Snow, which I read in about 3 days, was much better."

Not much of a story: Galip loses his long loved wife, and he searches for her. The book is about a certain time in the life of 'Istanbul'. The details and diversions are overwhelming. The author takes the book off track too often for a reader to stay focused."

This is the perfect read during the pandemic, too, as an epidemic takes place in the book and our two main characters retreat inward and begin to analyze themselves, searching for meaning, rather than the outside world. Pamuk's usual motif about blurring the lines between East and West is apparent here and makes the story all the better as we compare a Venetian and a Turkish man and their different perspectives. While The White Castle is reminiscent of the classics, it also has the pacing of a mystery novel and is incredibly readable. Pamuk reminds us to ""search for the strange and surprising in the world, not within ourselves;"" a relevant message for our times."

His scientific knowledge gives him a better life than most captives, as he becomes a Turkish scientist's assistant. The two look alike and share knowledge, work on projects and research various topics.. At the time this book is set, the knowledge is mainly from Venice to Istanbul, but much of the Venetian science had come from Istanbul earlier, when it was Constantinople.. This is a short book and seems to be straight historical fiction, but I think the author is exploring the symbiosis between east and west in the two characters and the two cities."
11/04/2021,b6,r1966,66836903,Donnie,"Jul 12, 2020",4,"The White Castle is an historical novel, by Orhan Pamuk.. The story is introduced as an old archived manuscript found currently in Turkey. The manuscript tells the story of a young Italian who is captured by Turkish troops while sailing towards Napoli in the XVIIth century. The bright youngster realizes he should be perceived as valuable to avoid more unpleasant living, and successfully impersonates a medical doctor. After gaining trust from authorities, he is sold as a slave to a man known as the ""Master"", who is physically identical to him although nobody acknowledges it. The Master makes the protagonist help him to develop scientific advancements, often mixing them with astrological and mythological stories in order to convince the authorities.. Most of the book depicts the ups and downs in the relationship between both men. The Master needs the Italian, but shows contempt towards him (which we don't know if its true, as the novel is narrated by the Italian). The Italian desperately wants to escape, but is unable to take the needed actions. He stays so long in Estambul that he starts forgetting his previous life and starts having delusions about him and the Master being the same person."

In the end I can't give it more than 3 stars because towards the end I was looking forward to it ending.. It's the story of a Turkish master and an Italian Slave who look very similar. Who's close proximity fosters a strange bond with loathing bubbling as much as respect.. Hoja is by far the most interesting character, I could never quite work out if he were a genius or mentally disturbed. Couldn't quite work out whether he was good or bad. It's in the unknown that I took some enjoyment.. I wouldn't say this is a book you had to ready, but it's so short it's probably worth it."
11/04/2021,b6,r1971,23939574,Rohan Kalia,"Nov 25, 2020",3,"Absurd in the beginning, absurd till the end.. Though this was my second time reading an Orhan Pamuk book and I thought I was prepared for the thrill-drama blend he offers, I wasn't for this particular one.. It starts with great intrigue and promise of resolution at some point. But the resolution to the puzzles never come and that keeps escalating the sense of thrill for what's to come, expectedly to come in the very end now. But it just ends with much more vagueness than it started with creating somewhat of an anti-climax - not an enjoyable one at that.. I don't care much for thrillers that leave both the 'how' and the 'why' unanswered and leave the reader/audience debating over what's real and what's not. So while it succeeds in creating a sense confusion and intrigue throughout (if that was really the intention), it failed to impress me personally.. Also if there were some underlying metaphors meant to be inferred, they were completely lost on me."
11/04/2021,b6,r1972,7404844,Emilia,"Jan 30, 2016",3,"It took me a few years to finish this book. I began reading it shortly after turning 16, not long before I moved to Turkey. It is Pamuk’s shortest novel (by far) and I figured that reading the country’s most prolific writer would prove insightful before I arrived. I am not ashamed to say that I bit off way more than I can chew. I frantically read and reread passages, trying to understand What The F%₺# was going on, until I was about a third of the way through, and I could no longer pretend. I abandoned my pride and the book. Don’t get me wrong, the writing is beautiful and the setting is utterly captivating, but Pamuk was moving in six different directions at once and I wasn’t able to keep pace. Fast forward a few years. I’m older, I have more reading experience, and I had spent a significant amount of time in Turkey without finishing a Pamuk novel. I decide to give this another go before attacking one of his longer books. I still think that a lot of the finer details of the story were lost on me, however I thoroughly enjoyed his exploration of identity.. The Republic of Turkey has, in many different ways and from its inception lasting to the current day, continuously battled with its identity. What I appreciated most about Pamuk’s take on the subject was that he completely refused to turn to the simplified and overdone “East vs. West” trope. Of course it is part of the equation, but this novel goes much further, asking more questions and leaving fewer certainties."
11/04/2021,b6,r1973,4567704,L.S. Popovich,"Nov 19, 2017",5,"This book was exactly the right length. It was refreshing to stumble upon this one as my first Pamuk read. A novel doesn’t have to be complicated to be good. All I want from a novel is an original story well-told, something that allows me to escape the mundanity of everyday life. Pamuk channeled medieval Turkey well, as he would consistently do in his other books. But this volume was not bogged down by unnecessary details. Each part of the story fed into the other parts. It was subtle and engaging. There was absolutely no dialogue from what I could tell and he blatantly violated the bogus rule of “show don’t tell.” The entire novel reads like someone telling something that happened over the course of time. It was straightforward and managed to seem elegant even though he didn’t do anything special. I later found out that Pamuk is at his best when he doesn’t try and do anything fancy.. I went on to read the rest of his novels (except Snow) and this is the one that stuck in my memory the most. The Black Book was more mesmerizing, but this is the one to start with if you're new to Pamuk."

Orhan Pamuk is incredible and uses such detailed insight -- the historical portrait of Turkey that he paints with his words is just beautiful, as well as his understanding of a human's struggle with identity.. ""When I tried to think of something else, the scene through the window overlooking the garden behind our house came to life before my eyes: peaches and cherries lay on a tray inlaid with mother-of-pearl upon a table, behind the table was a divan upholstered with straw matting strewn with feather cushions the same colour as the green window-frame; further back, I saw a sparrow perched on the edge of a well among the olive and cherry trees."""

Unfortunately, the one dimensionality of the first character was a major stumbling block for me in reading the book. For a book to reflect mostly on the self, that individual on whom I am forced to reflect should, at the very least, be interesting. Likable is not a requirement, but interesting is a must. Not only this, but the writing style was equally flat. It was painful to continue reading and I would have stopped had it not been a requirement for my book club."

Some even say the humans start looking like their cats/dogs. In Orhan Pamuk’s A White Castle, a Turkish master and his Venetian slave are brought together by a Pasha because they look alike. Over the years the physical similarities diffuse into other areas of their personalities in that sometimes they don’t know whether the thought they have in their head is their own or their doppelgänger’s. This fever dream of a novella discusses issues or identity while the protagonists deal with questions of astronomy, astrology, philosophy in a beautifully embroidered historical fiction setting."
11/04/2021,b6,r1978,1532590,Zach,"Jun 12, 2011",3,"The White Castle is more of an interesting book than an enjoyable one. Boiled down, it is a rumination on the nature of identity and the inner workings of the mind. It's rendered in simple and straightforward language, but I thought, especially in the middle of the book, that the thought processes were muddled. I don't know if this is a result of the translation or something lacking in the original. Pamuk seems like a perfectly capable philosopher, so I give him the benefit of the doubt. I'll probably try to read another book by him before I decide what I think of his style."

This book (by the award winning Orhan Pamuk, Turkey's most famous writer) features two men - one Venetian and one Istanbulite - who are spitting images of each other physically and become entangled in a complicated and tumultuous relationship that blurs the lines of their identities, and respective roles - one is a slave, the other his master. The plot twists and turns as their futures and even their pasts become intricately linked."

I didn't like this story too much, it was kind of predictible and in someways I felt I don't have enough layers revealed in order to really get his characters."

Just another post-modernism book without the sense of philosophy. Just repeating good myths and same things all over and over makes audience terribly bored. You can only write in this way if you dont have a thing to say, and this book didnt have any. Just like Turkish movie, it tried hard to show prostitutes as innocent creatures. This book tried to picture free love, cheating, and adultry as ""natural"" thing in society and specially among men, who have to blame for it. While we ourselves witnessed that it was the red-woman herself that deluded the young boy with her lewd and inviting acts, yet at the end this prostitute wouldn't be prosecute! How can she be innocent while she had three-years relationship with a married man? Then marry the other? Then marry his brother? Then as a married woman delibrately deludes and sleeps with a young teenager who was its ""first"" love son?. There is no sense in this book! Not a though-provoking book. As a woman, I say, ""Nay! Not all women are innocent! Sometimes women are free to choose their way. She was as free as the young teenager to decide what to do. And yet, she was two times older than him! She was a pedophil!. As I said, this book was worthless to read, and I regret the time I had wasted on it."

11/04/2021,b7,r2308,44389121,Lisa Edwards,"Jul 30, 2018",4,My first book by this Turkish author and definitely not my last. I loved this narrative - I only docked a star because I thought the Oedipal theme didn’t need to be so heavy-handed. Let the reader do the work. Can’t wait to read more.

But there’s no morality in it, until the end. But I still give it five stars because it was beautifully written. Istanbul and Turkey was beautifully described."
11/04/2021,b7,r2310,81744856,Malika,"Oct 27, 2018",4,"Good book but I preferred ""my name is Red"". Here the end is not really a surprise and one wonders if it could not have been different. My favourite part of the book was when the main character was yound and was digging that well with his master."

I felt I was in the city again, only this time not so much as a visitor, but as one who knew more of its ways, its back streets, its street vendors, its traditions. A Strangeness in My Mind is one of those books that can take the reader from a culture completely different from her own, and make it familiar, because its focus is upon what people from different cultures still have in common: family, the desire for love, some traditions that nourish."

This is the fourth Orhan Pamuk book I have tried to read. I finished his book Istanbul but wasn’t able to finish my name is Red, Snow or this one. Maybe Pamuk is just not for me though I really really wish it was. I might try My Name is Red again. I did like the story of Snow just that it got a bit depressing and too long. This one, after an exciting and promising start, just lost me."
11/04/2021,b8,r2613,11742208,Ellen,"Jan 11, 2017",4,"A whopper of a book detailing much of the life of Mevlut, a yoghurt-seller, boza seller, ice-cream seller, hard-working man with big ambitions. This story details his life from teenager working with his father in Istanbul through to older man with his own two married children and a second wife. It's not an action-packed tale but a gentle canter through a mostly gentle life, illustrated through the nuances of family relationships."
11/04/2021,b8,r2614,7724764,Diana,"Feb 10, 2017",4,"I was surprised I liked this as much as I did. At a first glance, there was nothing me or my generation could have in common with the main character, but the more you read.... This is a lengthy, full of description book. You need patience and a desire to really understand in order to finish. But if you've read anything by Pamuk before, you know he usually saves the best for the last. The ending was utterly lovely and emotional and a great fit for the whole story."
11/04/2021,b8,r2615,29536364,Emma Harrison,"Feb 13, 2017",5,"I have never read anything by this author before and I loved this book. Mainly because of the central character, Mevlut. Through the many years the story covers Mevlut continues to sell the traditional drink Boza; enabling him to meet many varied citizens of Istanbul and chart the changes that occur over the years. Mevlut is a soft-hearted man but observant, philosophical and afraid of the dogs who lurk in the corners of the city. You need to read it!"
11/04/2021,b8,r2616,46917225,Udyan Khanna,"Jun 24, 2017",5,"A heartfelt narrative of a beautiful soul in turbulent and growing Istanbul.. Melvut is a devoted son, scholar, husband, father and believer. He has led an honest life selling yogurt and booza. In that life, he has seen Istanbul grow, develop and transform. This is a great novel from a master story teller on his culture and the city he loves. Melvut's love story is tender, optimistic and addicting to read. A must read book."
11/04/2021,b8,r2617,61768135,Nurgül hati,"Jul 20, 2017",2,"Without any doubts Pamuk is a great writer. But I hate the story in this book. It suffocated me and disturbed me.. I would nobody recommend it.. I've read it in very long time as I protested it and refused myself to finish.. But within the book itself, It was fluent reading and didn't feel bored, due to Pamuk's writing skills.. So happy finally finished this book. This was last time I've read a book of Orhan Pamuk."
11/04/2021,b8,r2618,1064727,Suzanne,"Aug 17, 2017",3,"Melancholy, sprawling story about a man's love of his wife, a city (Istanbul) and all the people who live there. Mevlut has a curiosity about people and why things occur yet he just lets life happen to him. I enjoyed discovering the history and growth of Istanbul spanning 40 years - all as seen from Mevlut's family. The book is so well written and poetic - yet I needed something more upbeat at this time in my life - that's why 3 stars instead of 4."
11/04/2021,b8,r2619,1360420,Arinamidalem,"Sep 30, 2017",4,"I am glad Pamuk took me to see Istanbul from old days to current days.. Also to get to see its people, it is like watching my-big-fat-greek-wedding, so many characters show up in the story.. We are brought to witness Mevlut life from childhood, marriage life, domestic life problem, until he lost the love of his life. I love the last part when Mevlut think about Rahiya, or maybe what Pamuk think of Istanbul. :)"
11/04/2021,b8,r2620,13316114,Sandra,"Oct 15, 2017",5,"It always takes me time to read out Pamuk's books. But it is always such a pleasure to enter his storytelling world. This one is a story of an simple boza seller and his family. But also, as usual, a story of Istanbul. It is beautiful read right through. I also finally got arranged marriage explained properly 😉😉😉. ""But I think it must be easier for a girl to marry someone she doesn’t know, because the more you get to know men, the harder it is to love them."""
11/04/2021,b8,r2621,28914878,Jaimi Titherington,"Feb 06, 2018",5,"This book was beautiful, it had such intricate and elaborate detail. I thought the transitioning narrator brought an interesting aspect to the story, and I found myself distrustful of parts of each of their versions of events. I thought the writing was rich, and it doesn't surprise me that this was on the list for the Man Booker Prize.. I found myself both rooting for Mevlut, and wanting to shake him. Wonderfully crafted!"
11/04/2021,b8,r2622,39134645,Cathy T,"Apr 16, 2018",4,"This is a tome of a book weighing in at 740 pages or so. It is about a part of the world about which I knew very little, the characters are quite ordinary, and yet I was mesmerised and entranced by the story of Mevlut. If defining characteristics of a good book are that it makes you want to explore a different part of the world, understand more (for example about the history of a nation) and reflect again and again upon completion, then this is definitely a strong candidate."
11/04/2021,b8,r2623,8733845,Rajat,"Jun 25, 2018",5,"The review on the cover read - 'life-affirming storytelling at it's finest', and it indeed was an experience to read the story through all it's characters Melvut, Rahiya, Samiha, Vediha, Korkut, Suleyman, Crooked-neck Abdurrahman and others. The story of an everyday men, his life, dreams, imaginations and struggles seeped in my heart with extraordinary fluency.and so elegantly that I felt that I was the boza-seller in the streets of Istanbul. Such was the brilliance of Orhan Pamuk's narration."
11/04/2021,b8,r2624,54290438,Kari Ni,"Sep 03, 2018",5,"A book about the dreamer Mevlut, whose social 'strangeness' turns out to be his moral triumph. While the people around him aim at great fortune, money and power at a high cost, the character lives in his own world exploring new dimensions of his vivid imagination and following his own moral principles. The book leaves a scent of hope for the power of life and its unpredictable ways of giving us more, while taking away everything we thought we needed."
11/04/2021,b8,r2625,372881,Masha,"Oct 30, 2018",4,"Everything is much more connected and interconnected that you imagined. While I am still very far to know much about the contemporary history of Turkey, the book carefully strung in the ""bigger"" events in the narrative to only slightly push forward the plot but not being intrusive at all. The pace of the book might be slow for someone but I think in the end it worked out well. Despite careful work of the author, I still think the ending could be better. But endings are always the hardest 惟終實難."
11/04/2021,b8,r2626,72987076,Saliha Ozis,"Dec 23, 2018",5,"I loved the way how Orhan Pamuk enriches the protagonist Mevlut, a ""simple character"" for most of us. I really enjoyed reading Orhan Pamuk's narrations and transitions on how Mevlut feels about himself and the worlds he lives through the concept of ""stranges in his mind"". In addition, I got to know more about the supporting characters since the author explains events from their point of views and this populates Mevlut's world and helps the story move along."
11/04/2021,b8,r2627,630958,Jenny,"Feb 21, 2019",3,"A musing on life, cities (Istanbul), development, social class differentiation, migration, and more, from an urban philosopher, such a good man. A true love story, he ponders the difference between actions and intentions, and which count for more. It was a little tedious at time, but the main character is so pure and likeable, I wanted to champion him when he wasn't doing it well enough for himself!"

11/04/2021,b8,r2629,91807292,Tanya B,"Aug 20, 2019",4,"Unfortunately I chose to read this book at a time when I didn't have any time to read a book. Once I could finally sit down and read, I enjoyed this book. History is woven with a love story and the realities that come with family powers and jealousies. I found myself gasp aloud, cry, and reflect as I read this story. Luckily there is a family tree included, as sometimes I was lost with names and relationships. I would recommend this story, and am curious by some other titles by the author."
11/04/2021,b8,r2630,135754,Carol,"Dec 20, 2019",4,"This incredibly loooong book, with a strangely quiet and meandering style, somehow kept me engaged throughout. It's hard for me to say exactly how it did it, especially since this is a very male-perspective narrative. And yet, somehow, I think this story, which definitely took me to places I have never been, will be one of the books I remember most from this year. It's a book about place, about time, and people living unremarkable lives as history happens."
11/04/2021,b8,r2631,110268417,Mikaela Balkind,"Feb 17, 2020",2,"The storyline and characters initially interested me but about 400 pages in the story began to drag on without much excitement. The main character was charismatic and it was intriguing to learn about the life of a boza seller, but very little occurs throughout the story that leaves a lasting impression on the reader.. I would recommend this book to anyone who has visited Istanbul, as it was a exciting to recognize the neighborhoods and areas mentioned but other than that I would not recommend this book to other readers unfortunately."

As ever he manages to beautifully evoke the sounds and sights of Istanbul but the novel covers a significant period of time and is populated by a large cast of characters. As a result I found numerous passages very sprawling while adding little to the story. I still look forward to reading more of his stuff, though."

Oh, he's still selling yoghurt? OK, that's good to know. Oh, he met some people while selling yoghurt? Alrighty then.. I actually thought the book started out strong and that I was going to like it, but then I got bored. I decided to give up after listening to the audiobook for four hours. It took me nearly three weeks to get through those four hours!"
11/04/2021,b8,r2634,32128204,Ewa Klimuk,"Apr 19, 2020",5,"I love such books, and I can’t help it. A classical novel, with easy to follow plot and lovely main characters. As I don’t see many of those in modern novels, I treated this book as a real pearl.. .... The lecture had a therapeutic effect on me. I loved those moments when I fully immersed myself into the reality described in the book. I was literally roaming around main streets of Istanbul together with Mevlut. I am so sad the book is over."
11/04/2021,b8,r2635,106882829,Sibel,"Apr 25, 2020",5,"This is my first meeting with Orhan Pamuk's style and I can say that I totally liked it! He has a simple but fascinating writing style. You feel like you are walking with Mevlut in Istanbul streets. The book doesn't only tell us the story of Mevlut but also the political, economic and sociological changes of Turkey and Istanbul, like a storyboard... I can not say he is totally objective but still, I liked this novel."
11/04/2021,b8,r2636,13985981,Kirk,"Oct 10, 2020",3,"A lyrical and thoughtful homage to the author's birth city. Though I found many of the vignettes of his characters mildly entertaining, I felt the true purpose was to sketch his love for the city. Was I convinced? Not enough to accept it on faith from the author. I have enjoyed his magical-realistic fiction much more than this one, and recommend ""Snow"" or ""My Name is Red"" before giving up on this author."
11/04/2021,b8,r2637,93727867,Christina,"Nov 24, 2020",5,"I really loved this book. It is beautifully written, kind of dreamy, sometimes descriptive, sometimes thoughtful. One follows the life of Mevlüt who comes to Istanbul at a young age in the 1950s and the story continues until the early 2000s. This book is a declaration of love to Istanbul and sheds light on it from a very unique mind. This was my first Orhan Pamuk and I am excited to start my next one right away."
11/04/2021,b8,r2638,30125759,Margot Firth,"Dec 30, 2016",4,"An intriguing journey at first, through the ancient meet modern Istanbul and also, the workings of the mind, to find true happiness. The quest for love, longing, poetry , of hardships , belongings and family ties. Of changes to life as it was as a street vendor into the modern world, all in one lifetime. Not the easiest of reads with it's time shifts but well worth the trip."

The Little Prince, first published in April 1943, is a novella, the most famous work of French aristocrat, writer, poet, and pioneering aviator Antoine de Saint-Exupéry..

The story is philosophical and includes social criticism of the adult world. It was written during a period when Saint-Exupéry fled to North America subsequent to the Fall of France during the Second World War, witnessed first hand by the author and captured in his memoir Flight to Arras.. The adult fable, according to one review, is actually.

که درباره‌ ى جنگل بِکر نوشته شده بود- تصویر محشرى دیدم از یک مار بوآ که داشت حیوانى را مى‌بلعید. آن تصویر یک چنین چیزى بود:. تو کتاب آمده بود که: ""مارهاى بوآ شکارشان را همین جور درسته قورت مى‌دهند. بى این که بجوندش. بعد دیگر نمى‌توانند از جا بجنبند و تمام شش ماهى را که هضمش طول مى‌کشد مى‌گیرند مى‌خوابند"".؛. این را که خواندم، راجع به چیزهایى که تو جنگل اتفاق مى‌افتد کلى فکر کردم و دست آخر توانستم با یک مداد رنگى اولین نقاشیم را از کار درآرم. یعنى نقاشى شماره‌ى یکم را که این جورى بود:. شاهکارم را نشان بزرگتر ها دادم و پرسیدم از دیدنش ترس ‌تان بر مى‌دارد؟. جوابم دادند: -چرا کلاه باید آدم را بترساند؟. نقاشى من کلاه نبود، یک مار بوآ بود که داشت یک فیل را هضم مى‌کرد. آن وقت براى فهم بزرگترها برداشتم توى شکم بوآ را کشیدم. آخر همیشه باید به آن‌ها توضیحات داد. نقاشى دومم این جورى بود:. بزرگترها بم گفتند کشیدن مار بوآى باز یا بسته را بگذارم کنار و عوضش حواسم را بیش‌تر جمع جغرافى و تاریخ و حساب و دستور زبان کنم. و این جورى شد که تو شش سالگى دور کار ظریف نقاشى را قلم گرفتم. از این که نقاشى شماره‌ى یک و نقاشى شماره‌ى دو ام یخ شان نگرفت دلسرد شده بودم. بزرگترها اگر به خودشان باشد هیچ وقت نمى‌توانند از چیزى سر درآرند. براى بچه‌ها هم خسته کننده است که همین جور مدام هر چیزى را به آن‌ها توضیح بدهند.. ناچار شدم براى خودم کار دیگرى پیدا کنم و این بود که رفتم خلبانى یاد گرفتم. بگویى نگویى تا حالا به همه جاى دنیا پرواز کرده ام و راستى راستى جغرافى خیلى بم خدمت کرده. مى‌توانم به یک نظر چین و آریزونا را از هم تمیز بدهم. اگر آدم تو دل شب سرگردان شده باشد جغرافى خیلى به دادش مى‌رسد.. از این راه است که من تو زندگیم با گروه گروه آدم‌هاى حسابى برخورد داشته‌ام. پیش خیلى از بزرگترها زندگى کرده‌ام و آن‌ها را از خیلى نزدیک دیده‌ام گیرم این موضوع باعث نشده در باره‌ى آن‌ها عقیده‌ى بهترى پیدا کنم.. هر وقت یکى‌شان را گیر آورده‌ام که یک خرده روشن بین به نظرم آمده با نقاشى شماره‌ى یکم که هنوز هم دارمش محکش زده‌ام ببینم راستى راستى چیزى بارش هست یا نه. اما او هم طبق معمول در جوابم در آمده که: ""این یک کلاه است"". آن وقت دیگر من هم نه از مارهاى بوآ باش اختلاط کرده‌ام نه از جنگل‌هاى بکر دست نخورده نه از ستاره‌ها. خودم را تا حد او آورده‌ام پایین و باش از بریج و گلف و سیاست و انواع کرات حرف زده‌ام. او هم از این که با یک چنین شخص معقولى آشنایى به هم رسانده سخت خوش‌وقت شده.. این جورى بود که روزگارم تو تنهایى مى‌گذشت بى این که راستى راستى یکى را داشته باشم که باش دو کلمه حرف بزنم، تااین که زد و شش سال پیش در کویر صحرا حادثه‌یى برایم اتفاق افتاد؛ یک چیز موتور هواپیمایم شکسته بود و چون نه تعمیرکارى همراهم بود نه مسافرى یکه و تنها دست به کار شدم تا از پس چنان تعمیر مشکلى برآیم. مساله‌ى مرگ و زندگى بود. آبى که داشتم زورکى هشت روز را کفاف مى‌داد.. شب اول را هزار میل دورتر از هر آبادى مسکونى رو ماسه‌ها به روز آوردم. پرت افتاده‌تر از هر کشتى شکسته‌یى که وسط اقیانوس به تخته پاره‌یى چسبیده باشد. پس لابد مى‌توانید حدس بزنید چه جور هاج و واج ماندم وقتى کله‌ى آفتاب به شنیدن صداى ظریف عجیبى که گفت: ""بى زحمت یک برّه برام بکش!"" از خواب پریدم.. - ها؟. - یک برّه برام بکش.... چنان از جا جستم که انگار صاعقه بم زده. خوب که چشم‌هام را مالیدم و نگاه کردم آدم کوچولوى بسیار عجیبى را دیدم که با وقار تمام تو نخ من بود. این بهترین شکلى است که بعد ها توانستم از او در آرم، گیرم البته آنچه من کشیده‌ام کجا و خود او کجا! تقصیر من چیست؟ بزرگتر ها تو شش سالگى از نقاشى دل‌سردم کردند و جز بوآى باز و بسته یاد نگرفتم چیزى بکشم.. با چشم‌هایى که از تعجب گرد شده بود به این حضور ناگهانى خیره شدم. یادتان نرود که من از نزدیکترین آبادى مسکونى هزار میل فاصله داشتم و این آدمى‌زاد کوچولوى من هم اصلا به نظر نمى‌آمد که راه گم کرده باشد یا از خستگى دم مرگ باشد یا از گشنگى دم مرگ باشد یا از تشنگى دم مرگ باشد یا از وحشت دم مرگ باشد. هیچ چیزش به بچه‌یى نمى‌بُرد که هزار میل دور از هر آبادى مسکونى تو دل صحرا گم شده باشد.. وقتى بالاخره صدام در آمد، گفتم:. -آخه... تو این جا چه مى‌کنى؟. و آن وقت او خیلى آرام، مثل یک چیز خیلى جدى، دوباره در آمد که:. - بى زحمت واسه‌ى من یک برّه بکش.. آدم وقتى تحت تاثیر شدید رازى قرار گرفت جرات نافرمانى نمى‌کند. گرچه تو آن نقطه‌ى هزار میل دورتر از هر آبادى مسکونى و با قرار داشتن در معرض خطر مرگ این نکته در نظرم بى معنى جلوه کرد باز کاغذ و خودنویسى از جیبم در آوردم اما تازه یادم آمد که آنچه من یاد گرفته‌ام بیش‌تر جغرافیا و تاریخ و حساب و دستور زبان است، و با کج خلقى مختصرى به آن موجود کوچولو گفتم نقاشى بلد نیستم.. بم جواب داد: -عیب ندارد، یک بَرّه برام بکش.. از آن‌جایى که هیچ وقت تو عمرم بَرّه نکشیده بودم یکى از آن دو تا نقاشى‌اى را که بلد بودم برایش کشیدم. آن بوآى بسته را. ولى چه یکه‌اى خوردم وقتى آن موجود کوچولو در آمد که: -نه! نه! فیلِ تو شکم یک بوآ نمى‌خواهم. بوآ خیلى خطرناک است، فیل جا تنگ کن. خانه‌ى من خیلى کوچولوست، من یک بره لازم دارم. برام یک بره بکش.. - خب، کشیدم.. با دقت نگاهش کرد و گفت:. -نه! این که همین حالاش هم حسابى مریض است. یکى دیگر بکش.. - کشیدم.. لبخند با نمکى زد و در نهایت گذشت گفت:. -خودت که مى‌بینى... این بره نیست، قوچ است. شاخ دارد نه.... باز نقاشى را عوض کردم.. آن را هم مثل قبلى ها رد کرد:. - این یکى خیلى پیر است... من یک بره مى‌خواهم که مدت ها عمر کند.... بارى چون عجله داشتم که موتورم را پیاده کنم، با بى حوصلگى جعبه‌اى کشیدم که دیواره‌اش سه تا سوراخ داشت، و از دهنم پرید که:. - این یک جعبه است. بره‌اى که مى‌خواهى این تو است.. و چه قدر تعجب کردم از این که دیدم داور کوچولوى من قیافه‌اش از هم باز شد و گفت:. - آها... این درست همان چیزى است که مى‌خواستم! فکر مى‌کنى این بره خیلى علف بخواهد؟. - چطور مگر؟. - آخر جاى من خیلى تنگ است.... - هر چه باشد حتماً بسش است. بره‌ یى که بت داده‌ام خیلى کوچولوست.. - آن قدرهاهم کوچولو نیست... اِه! گرفته خوابیده.... و این جورى بود که من با شهریار کوچولو آشنا شدم.. خیلى طول کشید تا توانستم بفهمم از کجا آمده. شهریار کوچولو که مدام مرا سوال پیچ مى‌کرد خودش انگار هیچ وقت سوال‌هاى مرا نمى‌شنید. فقط چیزهایى که جسته گریخته از دهنش مى‌پرید کم کم همه چیز را به من آشکار کرد. مثلا اول بار که هواپیماى مرا دید (راستى من هواپیما نقاشى نمى‌کنم، سختم است.) ازم پرسید:. - این چیز چیه؟. - این ""چیز"" نیست: این پرواز مى‌کند. هواپیماست. هواپیماى من است.. و از این که به‌اش مى‌فهماندم من کسى‌ام که پرواز مى‌کنم به خود مى‌بالیدم.. حیرت زده گفت: -چى؟ تو از آسمان افتاده‌اى؟. با فروتنى گفتم: -آره.. گفت: -اوه، این دیگر خیلى عجیب است!. و چنان قهقهه‌ى ملوسى سر داد که مرا حسابى از جا در برد. راستش من دلم مى‌خواهد دیگران گرفتارى‌هایم را جدى بگیرند.. خنده‌هایش را که کرد گفت: -خب، پس تو هم از آسمان مى‌آیى! اهل کدام سیاره‌اى؟.... بفهمى نفهمى نور مبهمى به معماى حضورش تابید. یکهو پرسیدم:. -پس تو از یک سیاره‌ى دیگر آمده‌اى؟. آرام سرش را تکان داد بى این که چشم از هواپیما بردارد.. اما جوابم را نداد، تو نخ هواپیما رفته بود و آرام آرام سر تکان مى‌داد.. گفت: -هر چه باشد با این نباید از جاى خیلى دورى آمده باشى.... مدت درازى تو خیال فرو رفت، بعد بره‌اش را از جیب در آورد و محو تماشاى آن گنج گرانبها شد.. فکر مى‌کنید از این نیمچه اعتراف ""سیاره‌ى دیگر""ِ او چه هیجانى به من دست داد؟ زیر پاش نشستم که حرف بیشترى از زبانش بکشم:. - تو از کجا مى‌آیى آقا کوچولوى من؟ خانه‌ات کجاست؟ بره‌ى مرا مى‌خواهى کجا ببرى؟. مدتى در سکوت به فکر فرورفت و بعد در جوابم گفت:. - حسن جعبه‌اى که بم داده‌اى این است که شب‌ها مى‌تواند خانه‌اش بشود.. - معلوم است... اما اگر بچه‌ى خوبى باشى یک ریسمان هم بِت مى‌دهم که روزها ببندیش. یک ریسمان با یک میخ طویله.... انگار از پیش‌نهادم جا خورد، چون که گفت:. - ببندمش؟ چه فکر ها!. - آخر اگر نبندیش راه مى‌افتد مى‌رود گم مى‌شود.. دوست کوچولوى من دوباره غش غش خنده را سر داد:. - مگر کجا مى‌تواند برود؟. - خدا مى‌داند. راستِ شکمش را مى‌گیرد و مى‌رود.... - بگذار برود...اوه، خانه‌ى من آن‌قدر کوچک است!. و شاید با یک خرده اندوه در آمد که:. - یکراست هم که بگیرد برود جاى دورى نمى‌رود...؛ پایان نقل. تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 03/06/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"

The Little Princeis a novella by French aristocrat, writer, and aviator Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. It was first published in English and French, in April 1943.. The narrator begins with a discussion on the nature of grown-ups and their inability to perceive especially important things. As a test to determine if a grown-up is enlightened and like a child, he shows them a picture that he drew at the age of 6 depicting a snake which has eaten an elephant. The grown-ups always reply that the picture depicts a hat, and so he knows to talk of ""reasonable"" things to them, rather than fanciful.. The narrator becomes a pilot, and, one day, his plane crashes in the Sahara, far from civilization. He has 8 days of water supply and must fix his airplane to be saved. In the middle of the desert, the narrator is unexpectedly greeted by a young boy who is nicknamed as ""The Little Prince"". The prince has golden hair, a lovable laugh, and will repeat questions until they are answered.. Upon encountering the narrator, the little prince asks him to draw a sheep. The narrator first shows him his old picture of the elephant inside the snake, which, to the narrator's surprise, the prince interprets correctly. After three failed attempts at drawing a sheep, the frustrated narrator simply draws a box (crate), claiming that the sheep the prince wants is inside the box. Again, to the narrator's surprise, the prince exclaims that this was exactly the drawing he wanted. Over the course of eight days stranded in the desert, while the narrator attempts to repair his plane, the little prince recounts the story of his life. .... عنوانها: «شازده کوچولو»؛ «مسافر کوچولو»،

آدم­ها. گفت «سلام»؛ و مخاطبش گلستان پر گلی بود؛ گل­ها گفتند «سلام»؛ شهریار کوچولو رفت تو بحرشان؛ همه ­شان عین گل خودش بودند؛ حیرت­زده، ازشان پرسید: «شماها کی هستید؟»؛ گفتند: «ما گل سرخیم»؛ آهی کشید و سخت احساس شوربختی کرد؛ گل­ش به او گفته بود که از نوع او، تو تمام عالم فقط همان یکی هست، و حالا پنج­هزارتا گل، همه مثل هم، فقط تو یک گلستان؛ فکر کرد «اگر گل من این را می­دید بدجوری از رو می­رفت. پشت سر هم بنا می­کرد سرفه کردن، و برای این­که از هوشدن فرار کند، خودش را به مردن می­زد، و من هم مجبور می­شدم وانمود کنم به پرستاریش، وگرنه برای سرشکسته کردن من هم شده بود راستی راستی می­مرد.»؛ و باز تو دلش گفت «مرا باش که فقط با یک گل، خودم را دولتمند عالم خیال می­کردم، در صورتی­که آنچه دارم فقط یک گل معمولی است. با آن گل و آن سه تا آتشفشانی که تا سر زانومند و شاید هم یکی­شان تا ابد خاموش بماند، شهریار چندان پرشوکتی به حساب نمی­آیم.»؛ افتاد رو سبزه­ ها و زد زیر گریه؛ آنوقت بود که سر و کله ­ی روباه پیدا شد.؛ روباه گفت: «سلام.»؛ شهریار کوچولو برگشت، اما کسی را ندید.؛ با وجود این با ادب تمام گفت «سلام.»؛ صدا گفت «من اینجام، زیر درخت سیب.»؛ شهریار کوچولو گفت «کی هستی تو؟ عجب خوشگلی.»؛ روباه گفت «یک روباهم من»؛ شهریار کوچولو گفت «بیا با من بازی کن.، نمی­دانی چه قدر دلم گرفته.»؛ روباه گفت «نمی­توانم بات بازی کنم.، هنوز اهلی­ ام نکرده ­اند آخر.»؛ شهریار کوچولو آهی کشید و گفت «معذرت می­خواهم.»؛ اما فکری کرد و پرسید «اهلی کردن یعنی چه؟»؛ روباه گفت «تو اهل اینجا نیستی؛ پی چی می­گردی؟»؛ شهریار کوچولو گفت «پی آدم­ها می­گردم.؛ نگفتی اهلی کردن یعنی چه؟»؛ روباه گفت «آدم­ها تفنگ دارند و شکار می­کنند.؛ اینش اسباب دلخوری است.؛ اما مرغ و ماکیان هم پرورش می­دهند، و خیرشان فقط همین است؛ تو پی مرغ میگردی؟»؛ شهریار کوچولو گفت «نه، پی دوست می­گردم، اهلی کردن یعنی چه؟» روباه گفت «چیزی است که پاک فراموش شده.؛ معنی­ اش ایجاد علاقه کردن است.»؛ شهریار کوچولو پرسید «ایجاد علاقه کردن؟»؛ روباه گفت «معلوم اس.؛ تو الان واسه من یک پسربچه ­ای مثل صدهزار پسربچه ­ی دیگر.؛ نه من هیچ احتیاجی به تو دارم، نه تو هیچ احتیاجی به من؛ من هم برای تو یک روباهم مثل صدهزار روباه دیگر؛ اما اگر منو اهلی کردی هردوتامان به هم احتیاج پیدا می­کنیم؛ تو برای من میان همه­ ی عالم، موجود یگانه ­ای می­شوی، و من برای تو.»؛ شهریار کوچولو گفت «کم ­کم دارد دستگیرم می­شود.؛ یک گلی هست که گمانم مرا اهلی کرده باشد.»؛ روباه گفت «بعید نیست. رو این کره زمین هزار جور چیز می­شود دید.»؛ شهریار کوچولو گفت «اوه نه.، آن روی کره زمین نیست.»؛ روباه انگار حسابی حیرت کرده بود و گفت «رو یک سیاره دیگر است؟» _ آره.؛ _ «تو آن سیاره شکارچی هم هست؟» _ نه.؛ _ محشر است مرغ و ماکیان چطور؟؛ _نه.؛ روباه آه کشان گفت «همیشه خدا یک پای بساط لنگ است»؛ اما پی حرفش را گرفت و گفت «زندگی یکنواختی دارم.، من مرغ­ها را شکار می­کنم، آدم­ها مرا.؛ همه ­ی مرغ­ها عین هم اند، همه ی آدم­ها هم عین هم اند.؛ این وضع یک­خرده خلقم را تنگ می­کند.؛ اما اگر تو منو اهلی کنی، انگار که زندگیم را چراغان کرده باشی.؛ آن وقت صدای پایی را می­شناسم که با هر صدای پای دیگری فرق داشته می­کند.؛ صدای پای دیگران مرا وادار می­کند تو هفت تا سوراخ قایم بشوم، اما صدای پای تو، مثل نغمه­ ای مرا از لانه ­ام می­کشد بیرون.؛ تازه، نگاه کن آنجا، گندمزار را می­بینی؟ برای من که نان نمی­خورم گندم چیز بی ­فایده ­ای است.؛ پس گندمزار هم مرا یاد چیزی نمی­اندازد.؛ اسباب تأسف است.؛ اما تو، موهایت رنگ طلا است.؛ پس وقتی اهلی­ ام کردی محشر می­شود.؛ گندم که طلایی رنگ است، مرا به یاد تو می­اندازد، و صدای باد را هم که تو گندمزار می­پیچد دوست خواهم داشت.»؛ خاموش شد و مدت درازی شهریار کوچولو را نگاه کر؛د. آن وقت گفت «اگر دلت میخواهد منو اهلی کن.»؛ شهریار کوچولو جواب داد «دلم که خیلی می­خواهد، اما وقت چندانی ندارم، باید بروم دوستانی پیدا کنم و از کلی چیزها سر درآرم.»؛ روباه گفت «آدم فقط از چیزهایی که اهلی می­کند می­تواند سر درآرد.؛ آدم­ها دیگر برای سر درآوردن از چیزها وقت ندارند.؛ همه چیز را همین جوری حاضر آماده از دکان می­خرند.؛ اما چون دکانی نیست که دوست معامله کند، آدم­ها مانده ­اند بی دوست.؛ تو اگر دوست می­خواهی خب منو اهلی کن.»؛ شهریار کوچولو پرسید «راهش چیست؟» روباه جواب داد «باید خیلی خیلی صبور باشی، اولش یک­خرده دورتر از من می­گیری این جوری میان علف­ها می­نشین،. من زیرچشمی نگاهت می­ک،نم و تو لام تا کام هیچی نمی­گویی، چون سرچشمه همه ی سوء­تفاهم­ها زیر سر زبان است.؛ عوضش می­توانی هر روز یک خرده نزدیک­تر بنشینی.»؛ فردای آن روز دوباره شهریار کوچولو آمد پیش روباه.؛ روباه گفت «کاش سر همان ساعت دیروز آمده بودی.؛ اگر مثلا سر ساعت چهار بعد از ظهر بیایی، من از ساعت سه تو دلم قند آب می­شود، و هرچه ساعت جلوتر برود بیشتر احساس شادی و خوشبختی می­کنم.؛ ساعت چهار که شد دلم بنا می­کند شورزدن و نگران شدن.؛ آن وقت است که قدر خوشبختی را می­فهمم.؛ اما اگر تو هر وقت­ و بی­وقت بیایی من از کجا بدانم چه ساعتی باید دلم را برای دیدارت آماده کنم؟ هر چیزی برای خودش رسم و رسومی دارد.»؛ شهریار کوچولو گفت «رسم و رسوم یعنی چه؟»؛ روباه گفت «این هم از آن چیزهایی است که پاک از خاطره ها رفته، این همان چیزی است که باعث می­شود فلان روز با باقی روزها و فلان ساعت با باقی ساعت­ها فرق کند.؛ مثلا شکارچی­های ما میانِ خودشان رسمی دارند، و آن اینست که پنجشنبه ها را با دخترهای ده

نداشتم.»؛ به این ترتیب شهریار کوچولو روباه را اهلی کرد.؛ لحظه ی جدایی که نزدیک شد روباه گفت «آخ. نمی­توانم جلو اشکم را بگیرم.» شهریار کوچولو گفت «تقصیر خودت است.؛ من که بدت را نخواستم، خودت خواستی اهلی ات کنم.»؛ روباه گفت «همین طور است.»؛ شهریار کوچولو گفت «آخر اشکت دارد سرازیر می­شود.»؛ روباه گفت «همین طور است.»؛ شهریار کوچولو گفت «پس این ماجرا فایده ای به حال تو نداشته.»؛ روباه گفت «چرا، برای خاطر رنگ گندم.»؛ بعد گفت «برو یکبار دیگر گل­ها را ببین، تا بفهمی که گل تو، تو عالم تک است.؛ برگشتنا با هم وداع می­کنیم، و من به عنوان هدیه، رازی را به تو می­گویم.؛ شهریار کوچولو بار دیگر به تماشای گل­ها رفت و به آن­ها گفت «شما سر سوزنی به گل من نمی­مانید و هنوز هیچی نیستید. نه کسی شما را اهلی کرده، نه شما کسی را. درست همان جوری هستید که روباه من بود، روباهی بود مثل صدهزار روباه دیگر.، او را دوست خودم کردم و حالا تو همه ی عالم تک است.»؛ گل­ها حسابی از رو رفتند.؛ شهریار کوچولو دوباره درآمد که «خوشگلید اما خالی هستید.؛ برایتان نمی­شود مرد.؛ گفت ­و گو ندارد که گل مرا هم فلان رهگذر، گلی می­بیند مثل شما.؛ اما او به تنهایی از همه ی شما سر است، چون فقط اوست که آبش داده ام، چون فقط اوست که زیر حبابش گذاشته ام، چون فقط اوست که با تجیر برایش حفاظ درست کرده ام، چون فقط اوست که حشراتش را کشته ام (جز دو سه تایی که می­بایست پروانه بشوند)، چون فقط اوست که پای گله گذاری­ها و خودنمایی­ها و حتا گاهی بغ­ کردن و هیچی نگفتن­هایش نشسته ام، چون او گل من است».؛ و برگشت پیش روباه.؛ گفت «خدانگهدار»؛ روباه گفت «خدانگهدار»، و اما رازی که گفتم خیلی ساده است؛ جز با چشم دل هیچی را چنان که باید نمی­شود دید؛ نهاد و گوهر را چشم سر نمی­بیند؛ شهریار کوچولو برای آن که یادش بماند، تکرار کرد: «نهاد و گوهر را چشم سر نمی­بیند»؛ روباه گفت «ارزش گل تو به قدری است که پاش صرف کرده ای»؛ شهریار کوچولو برای آنکه یادش بماند، تکرار کرد ...؛ «به قدر عمری است که پاش صرف کرده ام»؛ روباه گفت «آدم­ها این حقیقت را فراموش کرده اند، اما تو نباید فراموشش کنی؛ تو تا زنده ای نسبت به آنی که اهلی کرده ای، مسئولی.؛ تو مسئول گلتی.؛ شهریار کوچولو برای آن که یادش بماند، تکرار کرد «من مسئول گلمم»؛. تاریخ بهنگام

گلستان پر گلی بود؛ گل­ها گفتند: سلام؛ شهریار کوچولو رفت تو بحرشان؛ همه ­شان عین گل خودش بودند؛ حیرت­زده، ازشان پرسید: شماها کی هستید؟ گفتند: ما گل سرخیم؛ آهی کشید و سخت احساس شوربختی کرد؛ گل­ش به او گفته بود، که از نوع او، تو تمام عالم تنها همان یکی هست، و حالا پنج­هزارتا گل، همه مثل هم، فقط تو یک گلستان؛ فکر کرد: اگر گل من این را می­دید، بدجوری از رو می­رفت؛ پشت سر هم بنا می­کرد سرفه کردن، و برای این­که از هو شدن فرار کند، خودش را به مردن می­زد، و من هم مجبور می­شدم، وانمود کنم به پرستاریش، وگرنه برای سرشکسته کردن من هم شده بود راستی راستی می­مرد؛ و باز تو دلش گفت: مرا باش که فقط با یک گل، خودم را دولتمند عالم، خیال می­کردم، در صورتی­که آنچه دارم، فقط یک گل معمولی اس؛. با آن گل، و آن سه تا آتشفشانی که تا سر زانومند، و شاید هم یکی­شان تا ابد، خاموش بماند، شهریار چندان پرشوکتی به حساب نمیآیم؛ افتاد رو سبزه­ ها، و زد زیر گریه. آن وقت بود که سر و کله ­ی روباه پیدا شد؛ روباه گفت: سلام؛ شهریار کوچولو برگشت، اما کسی را ندید؛ با وجود این با ادب تمام گفت: سلام؛ صدا گفت: من اینجام، زیر درخت سیب؛ شهریار کوچولو گفت: کی هستی تو؟ عجب خوشگلی؛ روباه گفت: یک روباهم من؛ شهریار کوچولو گفت: بیا با من بازی کن؛ نمی­دانی چه قدر دلم گرفته؛ روباه گفت: نمی­توانم بات بازی کنم؛ هنوز اهلی­ ام نکرده ­اند آخر؛. شهریار کوچولو آهی کشید و گفت: معذرت می­خواهم؛ اما فکری کرد و پرسید: اهلی کردن یعنی چه؟ روباه گفت: تو اهل اینجا نیستی؛ پی چی می­گردی؟ شهریار کوچولو گفت: پی آدم­ها می­گردم؛ نگفتی اهلی کردن یعنی چه؟ روباه گفت: آدم­ها تفنگ دارند و شکار می­کنند؛ اینش اسباب دلخوری است؛ اما مرغ و ماکیان هم پرورش می­دهند، و خیرشان فقط همین است؛ تو پی مرغ می­گردی؟. شهریار کوچولو گفت: نه، پی دوست می­گردم؛ اهلی کردن یعنی چه؟ روباه گفت: چیزی است که پاک فراموش شده؛ معنی­ اش ایجاد علاقه کردن است؛ ایجاد علاقه کردن؟ روباه گفت: معلوم است؛ تو الان واسه من یک پسربچه ­ای مثل صدهزار پسربچه ­ی دیگر؛ نه من هیچ احتیاجی به تو دارم نه تو هیچ احتیاجی به من؛ من هم برای تو یک روباهم، مثل صدهزار روباه دیگر؛ اما اگر منو اهلی کردی، هردوتامان به هم احتیاج پیدا می­کنیم؛ تو برای من میان همه­ ی عالم موجود یگانه ­ای می­شوی، و من برای تو؛. شهریار کوچولو گفت: کم ­کم دارد دستگیرم می­شود؛ یک گلی هست که گمانم مرا اهلی کرده باشد؛ روباه گفت: بعید نیست؛ رو این کره ی زمین هزار جور چیز می­شود دید؛. شهریار کوچولو گفت: اوه نه؛ آن روی کره زمین نیست؛ روباه انگار حسابی حیرت کرده بود و گفت: رو یک سیاره دیگر است؟ _ آره. _ تو آن سیاره شکارچی هم هست؟ _ نه. _؛ محشر است مرغ و ماکیان چطور؟ _نه؛ روباه آه کشان گفت: همیشه ی خدا یک پای بساط لنگ است؛ اما پی حرفش را گرفت و گفت: زندگی یکنواختی دارم؛ من مرغ­ها را شکار می­کنم، آدم­ها مرا؛ همه ­ی مرغ­ها عین هم اند، همه ی آدم­ها هم عین هم اند؛ این وضع یک­خرده خلقم را تنگ می­کند؛ اما اگر تو منو اهلی کنی، انگار که زندگیم را چراغان کرده باشی؛ آنوقت صدای پایی را می­شناسم که با هر صدای پای دیگری فرق داشته می­کند؛ صدای پای دیگران مرا وادار می­کند تو هفت تا سوراخ قایم بشوم، اما صدای پای تو، مثل نغمه­ ای مرا از لانه ­ام می­کشد بیرون؛ تازه، نگاه کن آنجا، گندمزار را می­بینی؟ برای من که نان نمی­خورم گندم چیز بی ­فایده ­ای است؛ پس گندمزار هم مرا یاد چیزی نمی­اندازد؛ اسباب تأسف است؛ اما تو، موهایت رنگ طلا است؛ پس وقتی اهلی­ ام کردی محشر می­شود؛ گندم که طلایی رنگ است، مرا به یاد تو می­اندازد؛ و صدای باد را هم که تو گندمزار می­پیچد دوست خواهم داشت؛. خاموش شد و مدت درازی شهریار کوچولو را نگاه ک؛د. آن وقت گفت: اگر دلت می­خواهد منو اهلی کن؛ شهریار کوچولو جواب داد: دلم که خیلی میخواهد، اما وقت چندانی ندارم؛ باید بروم دوستانی پیدا کنم، و از کلی چیزها سر درآرم؛ روباه گفت: آدم فقط از چیزهایی که اهلی می­کند می­تواند سر درآرد؛ آدم­ها دیگر برای سر درآوردن از چیزها وقت ندارند؛ همه چیز را همین جوری حاضر آماده از دکان می­خرند؛ اما چون دکانی نیست که دوست معامله کند، آدم­ها مانده ­اند بی دوست؛ تو اگر دوست می­خواهی خب منو اهلی کن؛. شهریار کوچولو پرسید: راهش چیست؟ روباه جواب داد: باید خیلی خیلی صبور باشی، اولش یک­خرده دورتر از من می­گیری ان جوری میان علف­ها مینشینی؛ من زیرچشمی نگاهت می­کنم، و تو لام تا کام هیچی نمی­گویی، چون سرچشمه همه ی سوء ­تفاهم­ها زیر سر زبان است؛ عوضش می­توانی هر روز یک خرده نزدیک­تر بنشینی؛. فردای آنروز دوباره شهریار کوچولو آمد پیش روباه؛ روباه گفت: کاش سر همان ساعت دیروز آمده بودی؛ اگر مثلا سر ساعت چهار بعد از ظهر بیایی، من از ساعت سه تو دلم قند آب می­شود، و هرچه ساعت جلوتر برود بیشتر احساس شادی و خوشبختی می­کنم؛ ساعت چهار که شد دلم بنا می­کند شورزدن و نگران شدن؛ آنوقت است که قدر خوشبختی را می­فهمم؛ اما اگر تو هر وقت­ و بی­وقت بیایی من از کجا بدانم چه ساعتی باید دلم را برای دیدارت آماده کنم؟ هر چیزی برای خودش رسم و رسومی دارد؛. شهریار کوچولو گفت: رسم و رسوم یعنی چه؟ روباه گفت: این هم از آن چیزهایی است، که پاک از خاطره ها رفته؛ این همان چیزی است که باعث می­شود فلان روز، با باقی روزها، و فلان ساعت، با باقی ساعت­ها فرق کند؛ مثلا شکارچی­های ما میانِ خودشان رسمی دارند، و آن اینست که پنجشنبه ها را با دخترهای ده می­روند رقص؛ پس پنجشنبه ها بره کشان من است؛ برای خودم گردش­ کنان می­روم تا دم موستان؛ حالا اگر شکارچی­ها وقت و بی­وقت میرفتند رقص، همه ی روزهای شبیه هم می­شد، و من بیچاره دیگر فرصت و فراغتی نداشتم؛. به این ترتیب شهریار کوچولو روباه را اهلی کرد؛ لحظه ی جدایی که نزدیک شد، روباه گفت: آخ؛ نمی­توانم جلو اشکم را بگیرم؛ شهریار کوچولو گفت: تقصیر خودت است؛ من که بدت را نخواستم، خودت خواستی اهلی ات کنم؛ روباه گفت: همین طور است؛ شهریار کوچولو گفت: آخر اشکت دارد سرازیر می­شود؛ روباه گفت: همین طور است؛ شهریار کوچولو گفت: پس این ماجرا فایده ای به حال تو نداشته؛ روباه گفت: چرا، برای خاطر رنگ گندم؛ بعد گفت: برو یک بار دیگر گل­ها را ببین، تا بفهمی که گل تو، تو عالم تک است؛ برگشتنا با هم وداع می­کنیم، و من به عنوان هدیه رازی را به تو می­گویم؛ شهریار

11/04/2021,b10,r2935,1713956,Manny,"Jul 24, 2018",5,"[Original review, Jul 24 2018]. This month, three plotlines in my life collided. I know Swedish and Norwegian well, and I'd thought vaguely from time to time that I'd like to learn Icelandic too; I've always been a great admirer of Tolkien, and I knew he had been interested in Icelandic; and I have a couple of Icelandic friends. But none of this had ever come to anything. Last week, however, Jupiter aligned with Mars and I entered the Age of Aquarius. I'd just finished reading. Tolkien: Maker of Middle-Earth. , which has many striking passages in Icelandic, Old Norse and Old English, and our friend K happened to be on Iceland. Fired with enthusiasm by Tolkien's love of these obscure but wonderfully poetic languages, I asked K if she could possibly get me one or two Icelandic children's books. I just don't know how to thank her: she turned up with not one or two but half a dozen books, including my favorite,. Le petit prince. . I spent the next few days carrying it with me everywhere, snatching all opportunities to try to make sense out of it.. For people who don't know anything about Icelandic, it has the same ancestor as Swedish, Danish and Norwegian. A thousand years ago they were the same language. But the mainland languages have evolved at a normal rate, while Icelandic, on its faraway island, has changed relatively little; so if you speak Swedish or Norwegian, it's like trying to read a language which for an English-speaker would be somewhere between Chaucer and Beowulf. You recognise a few of the words at once, others are more or less mangled, and still others are completely unfamiliar. The first impression is that it makes no sense at all. But I know. Le petit prince. , and I started trying to guess what word was what, just reading without looking anything up.. It was amazing to see how well this worked. For example, let me show you the following sentence:. Þar sem ég hafði adrei teiknað kind dró ég upp fyrir hann aðra af þeim tveimur myndum sem ég var fær að gera: myndina af kyrkislöngunni utanverði.. The first time I saw this, there were only a couple of words I felt at all sure about.. Upp. and. var. must be the same words as in Swedish (""up"" and ""was""). I soon figured out that. ég. was ""I"" (it is the same word in some Norwegian dialects),. að. was. att. (""that""), and. hann. was. han. (""he/him""). The words. mynd. and. kind. weren't like anything I recognised, but they were common, and having already come across them I realised they must be ""drawing"" and ""sheep"". As I read the book for the second time, the other words gradually fell into place too, and after a while I could read it as sort-of-Swedish:. Då som jag hadde aldrig tecknad får drog jag upp för honom den-andra av dem två teckningarna som jag var för att göra: teckningen av pytonormen utifrån.. which I might render into sort-of-English as:. Then as I had never drawn sheep pulled I up for him the-second of the two drawings which I was able-to make: the-drawing of the-python from-outside.. I recalled that there was a sentence something like this near the beginning of the story: it all made sense.. How does it work? I've been reading deep learning theory, and it's tempting to conceptualise it in terms of strengthening of neural pathways. I see a word I don't know, and I think of some words it could be:. aðra. to a Swedish-speaker first looks like. ådra. , ""vein"", and you only later think of. andra. , ""second"". This word occurs quite often. ""Vein"" never makes any sense, but ""second"" often makes good sense. So the pathway for. ådra. never gets strengthened but the one for. andra. does, and after a while my eyes just start seeing it as. andra. . The same thing happened with numerous other words. As I'm sure many language geeks will attest, it is such a weird and interesting feeling to find the sense emerging from words which initially looked like gibberish! I'm sorry if I've gone into too much detail here, but I wanted to explain what I mean when I say it's like doing drugs. You actually feel the text changing your state of consciousness.. Well, I'm hooked. Though so far, I've just barely started: the grammar is still a mystery to me. All the same, on my latest read-through I notice that the endings of nouns and verbs, which are first looked quite random, now seem to be displaying some recurrent patterns.... _________________________. [Update, Aug 6 2018]. I have been making efforts to understand in more quantitative terms what I've been doing here. First, I thought it would be a good exercise to try copying out the text of. Litli prinsinn. : this would force me to look carefully at every letter, and also give me a machine-readable version that I could analyse. I'm now about three-quarters of the way through (he has just said goodbye to the fox). I tried running my incomplete corpus, which contains about ten thousand words, through a script that Not and I developed last year.. The script is simple but quite useful. It counts frequencies for all the words in the corpus, then builds a hyperlinked concordance which shows me up to ten examples for each word. Every word is clickable, so I can take a word I'm unsure of in a sentence and see examples of that word in other contexts. There is a master index which lists all the words in descending frequency order. Here are the first 50 lines. The 'Freq' column gives the number of times the word occurs, and the 'Cumul' column gives the cumulative frequency:. All of these 50 words (to be exact, some of them are punctuation marks) are now very familiar to me, and as you can see they make up more than 50% of the text. I tried walking down the list to see when I stopped feeling confident. I can go as far as words with four or five occurrences, and I think I know what nearly all of them mean; that brings me up to about 400 words, and 75% of the total. When I look at words occurring two or three times, I start to feel uncertain, but I still think I know the majority of them. That gets me to 900 words and 86%. The 1600 words which only occur once are of course the hardest; but even here I feel I can guess a lot, perhaps a third to a half of them.. Copying out the text has sharpened my understanding of the grammar a good deal, and now I recognise quite a few endings. Though I'm still pretty hazy about the nouns. With multiple genders, multiple cases and marking for definiteness, there are many combinations, and I only know the most common ones.. It's surprising that one can extract so much information from a tiny sample of just ten thousand words. I'll see if I have the patience to finish this and then do. Ævintýri Lísu í Undralandi. as well.... ___________________________________. [Update, Aug 8 2018]. I have finished copying out the text of. Litli prins. ; the file now contains about 14,200 words and about 3,050 unique words. I made a small improvement to our script, so that it now creates an alphabetical index as well. This is very useful for finding copying errors: if I see two words close together which are almost the same, that often means that one of them is an error. Tidying up my copied text is not as tedious as I thought it would be. It's forcing me to look very carefully at everything and consolidate my extremely sketchy vocabulary.. I am sure there are still many errors left, but after this initial cleaning up pass I can look at my alphabetical index and get further on trying to understand the grammar. Here's a section showing forms of the word. stjarna. , ""star"", which occurs often in. Litli prins. .. Some of these are compound nouns: for example,. stjörnufræðingur. , literally ""star-ologist"" is ""astronomer"", and. stjarnfræðiþingi. , ""star-ology-thing"" is ""astronomical congress"". But what are all the others, most of which look like inflected forms? I can click on any of them and get a hyperlinked page of examples. For example, let's look at the page for. stjörnu. , which occurs 15 times:. I see that occurrences of. stjörnu. usually come after a preposition. For example, we have. Hann hefir aldrei horft á stjörnu. , ""He has never looked at. stjörnu. "", or. En þú ert hreinn og þú kemur frá stjörnu. , ""But you are pure and you come from. stjörnu. "". Most of the others are similar. Hm, looks like this is a dative singular? My suspicions are reinforced by the fact that Swedish used to have a dative; it disappeared long ago, but still survives in a couple of fixed expressions like. till salu. , ""for sale"", which has this. -u. ending.. Still a great deal more grammar to figure out! There are some improvements to the script that I hope to add soon, and which might help.... ___________________________________. [Update, Aug 12 2018]. I have added another little improvement to our script. It now creates a hyperlinked version of the original text, with the words colour-marked to show how frequently they occurred in the text you've read so far. The initial version uses four colours. Words are in black if they occur more than five times, blue if they occur four or five times, green if they occur two or three times, and red if they occur once. Here's an example, the start of the visit to the Drunkard:. The colours let you see at a glance approximately how well I now understand the text. Look at the first paragraph:. Á þriðja hnettinum bjó drykkjumaður. Heimsóknin þangað var mjög stutt, en hún fyllti litla prinsinn miklu þunglyndi.. (At the-third planet lived drunkard. The-visit there was very ?short, but it filled the-little prince much ?depression). Black words like. hnettinum. (""planet"", I think in the dative) and. mjög. (""very"") are quite familiar, and I am reasonably confident that I've guessed the green and blue ones correctly. Only two words,. stutt. (""short""?) and. þunglyndi. (""depression""?) are in red, and these are indeed the ones I feel least certain about. I'm pretty much guessing. stutt. from context. I'm more confident about. þunglyndi. , since I know from other examples that. þung. , cognate to Swedish. tung. , is ""heavy"",. lyndi. is probably something related to Swedish. lynne. , ""spirit"", and there is a Swedish word. tungsint. , ""heavy-spirited/depressed"".. This was an easier passage than average, and usually there is more red. But it feels motivating to think that, as I copy out more text and process it through the script, the red tide should start to recede.... [To. Ævintýri Lísu í Undralandi. ]"

11/04/2021,b10,r2961,1713956,Manny,"Sep 09, 2017",3,"We've just been in Italy for a couple of days, and luckily there was a bookshop a few doors down from the place we were staying. I bought some Italian books to try and make some progress on this language where I am still a total beginner. One of them was. Il piccolo principe. .. Well... having already read it in six languages (English, Swedish, French, German, Spanish and Russian), I could mostly follow the text. I don't think I know it by heart and am just pretending to read it, since I discovered earlier this year that I. couldn't. read it in Slovenian. There must be a technical name for what I'm doing, but I don't know what it is! Anyway, I'm sure I improved my vocabulary and grammar; every page, in fact almost every paragraph, I felt I'd learned something new. But I was disappointed to find that I couldn't enjoy it at all as poetry. I don't know if that was because the translation was uninspired, or, more likely, simply because my Italian is still so bad that I'm basically reading it as though it's weird French.. Damn. That which is essential is invisible to the eye, and only with the heart can one see rightly, but my heart is still unable to see the true form of. Il piccolo principe. . What do I need to do to awaken my inner. bambino. ? I will reread it and see if the book can tame me.. ____________________. Rereading worked very well! The book is doing a fine job of taming me: just as the wise old fox explains, words which once looked like ten thousand other words have become my friends. I look at them, and now they make me happy because they remind me of my favorite passages in. Il piccolo principe. . I have divided further explanation under two headings:. Grown-ups. I can understand over 80% of the words and over 90% of the sentences. I am starting to get some feeling for the grammar. The clitic system, in particular, is interestingly different from the French one I am used to. Clitics are by default postverbal affixes, and I'm fascinated by the exotic phenomenon of clitic-climbing. I still haven't got the verb inflections properly sorted out, but there's no doubt that they're starting to look familiar.. Children. I can finally hear the Little Prince's voice in Italian! He is not quite as annoying, funny and adorable as he is in French, but maybe a third reading will fix that."
11/04/2021,b10,r2967,1713956,Manny,"Aug 14, 2020",5,"Noticing that I enjoy reading French books, people often ask me how to begin. I usually tell them to pick up a copy of. Le petit prince. and start reading: after a while, things will fall into place. Having tried it a fair amount myself, I can report that this method works, but there are clear drawbacks. It takes a while, since you're figuring out what words mean by comparing different contexts of occurrence, and most often you've forgotten the last time you saw that word you know you recognise. Worse, if you're just guessing how words are pronounced by reading them, you'll usually guess the wrong pronunciation.. To make it easier for people who enjoy learning language by reading, we've been developing the. LARA platform. . Things have now progressed far enough that I'm going to change my advice: if you want to learn to read French, pick up. the LARA editor of. Le petit prince. and start reading. You'll find it. here. ; use Chrome or Firefox, other browsers are not yet well supported.. The LARA version has been designed to make it as easy as possible to use the learning-by-reading method. The whole text has been read by Hossein Khooshideh, a gifted Iranian-Swiss 12 year old who's done a really nice job of it; click on any speaker icon to hear Hossein read the preceding sentence. If you're unsure what a word means, you can get a translation by hovering your mouse over it, or you can see all the places where it occurs in the text by clicking.. Thanks to some energetic coding by Icelandic summer student Bjartur Örn Jónsson, you can also test your knowledge of the text. Go to. the LARA portal. , get yourself an account (it's free and takes one minute), and open Exercises > Flashcards from the menu on the left. Click on ""Take the test"" in the line labelled ""Le petit prince"", and choose the number and type of flashcards you want. You should get cards that look something like this (translations):. or this (sentence with gap):. Bonne lecture !"
11/04/2021,b10,r2984,1713956,Manny,"Mar 06, 2015",4,"We have visited Spain twice in the last year, and this time I decided that I really had to get better acquainted with the Spanish language. I knew that it was structurally very similar to French, but I had little vocabulary. I decided to try my usual first move: I went into a bookstore, bought a copy of. Le Petit Prince. , and opened it at page 1.. Not, who fails to share my passion for language, was skeptical. If I more or less know this book by heart, she asked logically, in what sense am I reading it? A perfectly good question; but what I'm doing, of course, is matching up the Spanish words and grammar to the text I can remember, and thereby increasing my command of Spanish. And it's worked quite well! In a couple of days, I have at least doubled my pitiful stock of words, and I'm starting to recognize the verb endings. Here's an example to show how far I've got. I give the Spanish original above and the sorta-French I am mentally filling in underneath:. —Señor —le dijo—, perdóneme si le pregunto.... -Sire -lui dit-(il)- pardonnez-moi si (je) vous interroge... — Te ordeno que me preguntes —se apresuró a decir el rey.. -(je) t' ordonne que (tu) m' interroges -s'est pressé à dire le roi.. —Señor... ¿sobre qué ejerce su poder?. -Sire ... sur quoi éxercisez-(vous) votre pouvoir?. —Sobre todo —contestó el rey con gran ingenuidad.. -Sur tout -répondait le roi avec grand ingenuité. —¿Sobre todo?. - Sur tout?. El rey, con un gesto sencillo, señaló su planeta,. Le roi, avec une geste ? , signalait sa planète,. los otros planetas y las estrellas.. les autres planètes et les étoiles.. So far, so good! I am now going to read the book a second time, and will then see how I do on something I'm not so familiar with..."
11/04/2021,b10,r2993,1713956,Manny,"Sep 26, 2016",3,"I did two years of Russian between the ages of 14 and 15, but since I never used it again I assumed I'd forgotten everything. When we were in Berlin this summer, we however passed a Russian bookshop, and I persuaded Not that we had to go in and look around. Twenty minutes later, we walked out again with a chess book, a monograph on Alekhine's Defense. I figured it would be enough to read the moves, but to my surprise I found after a while that I could understand some of the words too. Our Russian friend K encouraged me to continue and even gave me a Russian children's book as a present. This was too hard; but I figured that if I used my usual approach and began by reading. Le petit prince. , maybe things would carry on falling into place.. Well, I've now finished it and I'm still not quite sure if it's working. I did what I always do and just read it without looking anything up. Normally, I figure I'll guess plenty of words, partly through knowing the story very well and partly through comparing with languages I already know. This works fine for Germanic and Romance languages. For example, here's what I see when I look at a random passage in the Catalan edition (I don't know Catalan, and my Spanish is very poor). Underneath the Catalan, I put in the sorta-French I'm guessing:. Súbitamente el geûgrafo se sintiû emocionado:. Soudainement le géographe se sentait émotioné. -Pero... ¡tú vienes de muy lejos!. Mais ... tu viens de très loin!. ¡Tú eres un explorador! Vas a describirme tu planeta.. Tu es explorateur! Décris-moi ta planète.. Y el geûgrafo abriendo su regìstro afilû su lápiz.. Et le géographe en ouvrant son registre affilé son crayon.. Los relatos de los exploradores se escriben primero con lápiz.. Les histoires des explorateurs s'écrivent d'abord avec crayon.. Se espera que el explorador presente sus pruebas para pasarlos a tinta.. On espère que l'explorateur présente ses preuves pour les passer en encre.. It's pretty easy because my French is okay, I know a bit of Spanish, and in general I'm familiar with the principles of Romance languages.. But when I try to do the same thing in Russian, it's a whole lot harder. I don't have a good stepping-stone, since I don't know any Slavic languages, so I have to go all the way back to English. All the same, it's not impossible. Taking another randomly chosen passage from the Russian version, here's where I am right now:. - Красивая планета, - сказала змея.. - Pretty planet, - said snake.. - А что ты будешь делать здесь, на Земле?. - And what you will do here, on Earth?. - Я поссорился со своим цветком, - признался Маленький принц.. - I ?quarrelled? with my flower, - ?confessed? Little prince.. - А, вот оно что.... - A, ? ? what.... И оба умолкли.. And ? ?were-silent?. - А где же люди?. - And where people?. - вновь заговорил наконец Маленький принц.. - ?again? said at-last Little prince. - В пустыне все-таки одиноко.... - In desert ?so-all? alone.... - Среди людей тоже одиноко, - заметила змея.. - ?Among? people ?also? alone, - ?replied? snake.. Writing this down, I feel encouraged; I've definitely made progress. But I'm guessing so many words, and there are still so many words I can't even guess, and I can't appreciate the poetry of the book at all. I think I will read it again and see how much more I pick up on the second pass, then I will have another shot at. Про Ёжика и Медвежонка. ..."

I'm still not there, but my strategy is to start with foreign books I already know well. I've read. Le Petit Prince. many times; we were visiting a Zürich bookshop with a friend a few months ago, and when she noticed the German translation lying on the shelf I immediately bought it. Thank you, C! I've just finished, and it was indeed very helpful. I'm sure I've picked up a clutch of useful words and consolidated my shaky grammar.. When I did the same thing last year with Tove Jansson's. Kometen Kommer. , I thoroughly enjoyed the translated version. As I said in. my review. ,. Komet im Mumintal. felt exactly like the original. But, to my surprise,. Der Kleine Prinz. often came across as rather different from the book I was used to.. Sigh... to be honest, the differences were sometimes on the embarrassing side. Is it reasonable for my mind to suggest associations with Nazism, just because the book's in German? I have many German friends, and I don't think about Nazism when we're hanging out together. And the idea never once crossed my mind when I read about Mumin's adventures. But here, I'm afraid, it did. We got to the episode with the faithful Lamplighter, which I've always found both amusing and touching. The Lamplighter explains that he's unquestioningly following his orders, no matter how absurd they are, and all I could think was... well, I deeply apologize to my German friends, but you can perhaps guess the inappropriate thoughts my subconscious mind suggested to me.. The more I think about it, the more nonsensical it is. I mean, the Lamplighter is clearly French. He's just been. translated. into German. He's presented as a tragically lovable figure. There's no imputation whatsoever, the whole thing is in my imagination and I know it is. But all the same, my mind stubbornly insists on reading the book its own way.. Oh well. At least it's done my German some good. And after a while, I assume this kind of thing will stop happening..."

I am still impressed how long it takes the boy to die after being bitten by the snake, I am not sure that suicide by snake is a means of interplanetary transport that can be much recommended. This time I read with a dictionary and checked a few words as I went.

When I was small, I used to sit on my granny’s lap, and we used to stare out at the night sky from the porch. Till date, I haven't ceased to be amazed by that beautiful landscape roofed over our heads.. I used to ask Gran.. “What are those stars twinkling for?”. She used to give me the usual amazed smile of hers and say, “When you love someone so much that you don’t want them to go, they become one of those stars. A bright, shining star. So that you never forget how much you love them. Grandpa is one of them now. ”. The little prince reminded me of my granny.. “It will be as if, I had given you a great number of little bells that knew how to laugh…”. This book was so beautiful, it swept me off my feet. I have never felt so dumb in my entire life. Words have deserted me. There’s a wide hollow somewhere inside me, which doesn’t make me sad surprisingly. This book brought in me a kind of joy, that never could any of its predecessors do.. This is not a children’s tale. For each of us who has a child inside of us, this book is a reminder that the world is not always about figures and matters of consequence. Pure unadulterated beauty lies in gazing at the starry night, listening to the birds sing, watching the flowers dance with the sun looking at the clouds as they form delicate shapes while travelling from end to end.. “It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.”. This book taught me things that seem so simple on the outset, but things which are forgotten just as easily. Growing up is like thrusting yourself into a world of hypocrisy, ownership, competition, and selfishness. But that shouldn't be. For the child inside us still searches for a companion in times of loneliness. It still is on the lookout for love and care.. “They are pursuing nothing at all,” said the switchman. “They are asleep in there, or if they are not asleep they are yawning. Only the children are flattening their noses against the window panes.”. “Only the children know what they are looking for,” said the little prince. “They waste their time over a rag doll and it becomes very important to them; and if anybody takes it away from them, they cry….”. It's only when you care for something so much that you establish a special bond with them; the bond of eternal friendship. Merely claiming ownership over a kingdom doesn’t make you a good king. If you don’t claim responsibility for what you love, you lose the claim to it. And when you care and nurture it, it becomes rightfully yours. You are your own little prince then; a just and good prince.. When you love something so close to your heart, it makes that one star unique in the midst of a billion more stars.. “To me, you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little boys. And I have no need of you. And you, on your part, have no need of me. To you, I am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But if you tame me, then we shall need each other. To me, you will be unique in all the world. To you I shall be unique in all the world….”. “I am beginning to understand,” said the little prince. “There is a flower… I think she tamed me…”. Recommended to everyone who, like I said, has a child inside them. And who don’t engulf themselves in figures and numbers and the monotony of a grown-up’s life."
11/04/2021,b10,r3232,31162738,Josiah (bookishfanboy),"Jan 15, 2016",5,"You can read my book review on the blog. -. https://bookishfanboy.wordpress.com/2.... “The most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or touched, they are felt with the heart.”. The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry is a classic novel (originally known as Le Petit Prince) and was originally published in April 6, 1943. It follows a little boy who leaves his own tiny planet to travel the universe, learning the unexpected adult behavior through so many extraordinary encounters.. “All grown-ups were once children… but only few of them remember it.”. If you would ask me on who should read this book, I’d probably would say that this book is not intended for children but for the young-adult and adult who remembers being a child and feels nostalgic about it. And by the way, I think the young kids will not fully understand the true meaning of this book if they had a chance to read it.. The Little Prince – he’s one of the two protagonists of the story. He leaves his own planet and ends up on earth where he meets The Pilot stranded in a desert. The Little Prince, for me, symbolizes innocence and hope, even though he encountered many people or things he never stops loving the rose from his planet.. The Pilot – he’s the one who got stranded in the desert and became friends with the little prince. He is also the narrator of the story. The pilot is a grown-up but sees the world like a child than like an adult.. The Fox – I loved the fox. He’s my favorite character for the reason that he gave the important lessons in the book. That is 1) love involves responsibility and 2) the only thing that can see correctly is our heart.. Before going to Earth, The Little Prince traveled to the planets near him and met 6 grown-ups living in each of the planet. The first one he met was The King who think he can rule the entire universe, then he met The conceited man who sees himself as the most intelligent and handsomest man on his planet. He also met The Drunkard who spends his time drinking to forget that he is ashamed of drinking. Then there’s The Businessman who is very busy counting stars that he thinks he own, the Lamplighter who lights the lamp at sunset, a job that the little prince found useful. Finally, there’s The Geographer who writes down the information given to him by the explorers but he himself didn’t have any idea whether there are mountains or rivers.. “And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.”. The things that can we learn from this book is that we can only understand things if we experienced them and we cannot truly understand some things unless we search the meaning ourselves. We cannot just rely on others telling us things we should be experiencing it ourselves and we will learn from what is true. The story also teaches us the importance of friendship and responsibility. I love this book so much and now I know why this story is still being taught to students like me even though it was published years ago. It’s a gem, a treasure and a story that I will cherish forever. I gave this book 5/5 stars."
11/04/2021,b10,r3233,32084899,Nahida Luna,"Nov 17, 2014",5,"Not every book you meet in your lifetime touches your soul. Some do, in the weirdest possible way. You may or may not recognize that very special book while reading it. But just after finishing it, you know for sure, that the book you're holding in your hands right now contains your heart between the lines and pages. And that is exactly how I felt about this book.. It appears to be a children's book that contains the whole universe within. Well, it may or may not be the universe as we know it, but the book sure does say something about the eccentricities of a lifetime. What I think is it's for the kids who somehow managed to stay alive inside the grown-up bodies. As we grow up, we learn to think about matters of consequence... we learn to let go of the endless number of questions we once had in mind. We choose to forget what we once knew. This is a book about us adults...bossing around other people and fooling ourselves with the illusion of orderliness we think we created. It's about us boasting with pride, wanting to be admired by people around us. Still there are some of us who learn to be alone in this crowdy planet. As the author of this book accounts, ""all grown-ups were once children , although few of them remember it"", I love to think myself as one of those few.. The little ""me"" read and enjoyed the wonderfully illustrated book, and the grown up ""me"" was staggering under the weight of truths, truths about our very existence. This book has left me with a weird feeling of gain and loss at the same time.. As I dived into the pages, I found that it fancifully depicts the question ""What if, someday you come across the reflection of the kid you used to be?"" I think most of us would be ashamed of our own self. But in reality, we look for reflections of ourselves in everything. We constantly yearn for what we left on the one-way road that is life. The search for the long-lost pieces of our own selves never ends. We long for the treasure buried in the depth of an endless pit, never to be regained. We crave for the star that laughs.. The child inside us - more or less that's the price we all have to pay in order to fit ourselves in this world. The question remains as to whether it is worthwhile or not."

This sums up the whole thing. : I was in a bad mood when I picked it up, but my heart pumped happiness since I read it.. Whether you are an. adult. or a. child. , this book is for you.. “ Now here is my secret. It’s very simple. It is only with the heart that one can see clearly. What is essential is invisible to the eye.”. I’ll try not to spoil anything:. While the adult narrator is immersed in the problems of adults’ world, the little prince appears out of nowhere and carries him back to the world of children; a world that makes sense, compared to adults’ world. The little prince uses the magical words: draw me a sheep.. The little prince, as a child, attempts to understand the world of adults, but every time he comes across one he says:. “Grown-ups are very strange.”. . The little prince experiences love, sorrow, friendship, and other things that define us as humans. In short terms, this novel represents life as it is from the perspective of a really bright, wise child; the Little Prince.. Here are some amazing quotes that caught my eye or my heart, to be more precise.. “It is far more difficult to judge oneself than to judge other. If you succeed in judging yourself rightly, then indeed you are very wise”. ”only children know what they are looking for”. ""My star will just be one of these stars for you, so you will love looking up at them all. They will all be your friends. and I have a present for you... The stars mean different things to different people.When you look up at the sky at night, I shall be living on one of them and laughing. You and only you will have stars that can laugh ! "".

This is definitely the dreaded case of didn’t-love-it-didn’t-hate-it and I DON’T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH MYSELF.. Even though I did understand most of the millions of metaphors and allegories I felt like I was missing the whole point of this novel. IT DID NOTHING FOR ME. I FELT NOTHING. At this point, I have just read a novel about a very-small-boy-who-is-in-fact-very-small-and-has-questions-about-literally-everything-also-did-I-mention-he-is-very-small? Not really my type of genre.. I also haven’t figured out if this-not-feeling-anything has to do with the fact i already knew how it ended (spoilers are everywhere nowadays, people) or simply because I don’t have a heart. Will keep you updated on that one.. I did think the little boy was quite cute. 10/10 would adopt. Don’t know if I’d be able to handle all his questions, though. 10/10 would ducktape the crap out of him, but also, like, show him affection and, I don’t know, like, protect him.. Also, I did not understand the constant shitting on humanity. Yes, we have pricks like LITERAL DONALD TRUMP, but we also have sweethearts like LITERAL BERNIE SANDERS (look at my politics jokes! mom I made it). If it makes any difference, know that I DON’T hate everybody and I DO think some of us are pretty awesome at certain things. To 80% of human kind that isn’t shitty, you rock! Keep up the good work.

I love that such simplicity could speak so much depth, oh all those ironies and metaphors.. and yes, who doesn't love the fox.."

It's actually a lot harder to follow since you are missing out on the illustrations but as I'm familiar with them, I was okay.. The book still gets listed a lot as a children's book whereas I believe the story wouldn't have the same impact on me when I was younger. I love that the book's melancholy makes me tear up every time while the questions ask always hit home. They really make me stop and think.. There aren't many short books with well-known stories that I connect to this much. I definitely recommend the book if you haven't already read it."

I wasn't able to grasp the magic as well as I had hoped and failed to see the significance of most elements. It was an enjoyable read and I would have given it 5 stars had I understood it better.. Maybe I should have read this when I was a kid because now I feel a bit like the narrator, and close to becoming one of the ""adults"" in the story. Maybe I need to get my childish wonder back!. However, that's something that I believe played in my favour: this book's final message got to me. And I appreciate that.. 4 stars ~ This book grants an Acceptable (A) grade in Astronomy (N.E.W.T.s) ~"

It has an absurdist tinge to it and despite all its surface innocence is a lot deeper than it might seem to some.. I loved how the little prince narrates his love for a rose and how he nourishes it with so much care and yet the flower demands undue attention. While it might be that the relationship is with just an inanimate plant, but the human parallels cannot be ignored.. Somewhere in the middle of the book, the musings of the characters push you to questioning your own purpose in life and people around you. It was probably the intent of the author and he does it very well!"

This famous book manages to conjure a whimsical, nostalgic feel inside my adult head (and heart) that transports me to the time when one was young and curious, naive and simple (and yet complicated), brave and honest. It brings me to question my inner child and wonder where did she went and is she still inside of me. I need to let her out once in a while."

11/04/2021,b11,r3553,17262906,Momina Masood,"Sep 23, 2013",3,"The problem with translations is that you can never be sure whether the stylistic faults lie with the original or have been conferred upon it during the process of translation. Hesse's sentence and dialogue comes off as singularly clumsy and cacophonic in the translation, at least in the one that I read. Anyhow, those well-versed in the original language might better judge these things.. The story sails smoothly. I cannot say that this book will tell you anything new or will enlighten in any way but it is a quick and pleasant read, despite the translation problems, and is filled with great reminders. I do not find myself in awe of Siddhartha by the end of the read but I do find within myself respect and admiration for a man who sought his own answers and struggled for them. There is such a seeker of answers in each one us, and it is for this reason that this book could be appreciated by all. Not an altogether futile read, in my opinion, but neither a glorious one."
11/04/2021,b11,r3554,27279716,Vishwanath Saragadam,"Dec 26, 2015",5,"When I was a teenager, I used to read Chandamama a lot. Jataka tales was one of many stories in each magazine. In each story, the Buddha is born as a different person is a kingdom. Curious is this coincidence, as Hesse's Siddartha goes through various stages in life, very similar to the Jataka tales.. The theme itself is incredible, that teachings are but just words, and the true essence of enlightenment is each one's own path. The journey of Siddartha was rather confusing in the beginning. I did not understand why he would go through the colloquial vices, but it was clearer over the course of the book. I feel that the book describes the turmoil of many people, and that Govinda, Siddartha, Kamala and so on are characters always existing in our lives. Eventually, everyone finds their path. I think it would be nice if we understand which of these characters we are, or if we are a combination of everyone."
11/04/2021,b11,r3555,7366675,Morgan,"Jan 02, 2014",3,"The main reason I like the book is for Hesse's writing and the meaning of the book. Other then that, I'm afraid I'm not a fan of Siddhartha. I like experimental novels, but the main problem I had with this book is that it wasn't really a novel. I felt like this was a early addition of a self-help book. Which is sadly the reason I'm rating this lower then I want to. Maybe if this was actually about Buddha and his life and actual teachings I'd like this better. Honestly, I found Osamu Tezuka's Buddha manga a better read then this at times. It teaches the same things this book does, but has a story and explains this to you in a better way. I also didn't really care for this book because I feel like it needs footnotes or a teacher telling you what's what. I knew some stuff, but I was lost most of the time."
11/04/2021,b11,r3556,6243880,Gary  Beauregard Bottomley,"Jan 05, 2015",4,"One can either listen to a long boring Great Course Lecture series on Buddhism and Eastern Thought or one can listen to this fairly entertaining book and come away with the same depth of understanding on how the introspective path can lead towards enlightenment.. The author clearly wants to share a reasonable interruption of Eastern Thought, and does it quite cleverly by looking at the life of one fictional person, Sidhartha, and how he learns enlightenment through his many phases of his life.. In the end (for me) there is no Eastern Solution for enlightenment but I find the doubt from introspection to be much more worthwhile than the certainty that comes from the revealed religions of the West. I keep meaning to finish that Great Course Lecture I have, but just have never found the time. Perhaps this book will urge me towards that."

Although published in 1922, it was very popular with my hippie friends in the 60s and 70s. I guess I was too busy working to notice. But then at 60 I was doing some psychological upgrades, and my therapist/teacher suggested this book. To help with existential angst and all that.. This version had some translation errors, but I got it free from public domain so can't complain, and anyway they didn't interfere with my understanding it.. I couldn't wait to read it each evening. It's an interesting story, but the insights are the meat and potatoes. I made so many notes and highlights I'm going to spring for an actual physical book and transfer them to it, to keep forever. A great introduction to Buddhism, which has sparked my interest and curiosity for more."

If I didn’t have a rudimentary understanding of the most basic tenets of Hinduism and Buddhism, I might feel differently. However I do, and the book strikes me mostly as a European rehash of ancient Vedic ideas.. I also derive little pleasure from quest for enlightenment stories. I expect that’s partly because I neither need nor desire an outside meaning for life. I make my own purpose. Being is enough for me, so I struggle to relate to people whose sole source of unhappiness is not knowing the ultimate truth of life.. Also I must say, the lead character is utterly unappealing. He's miserable and superior pretty much up until the last ten pages or so. Everything is made so easy for him, yet he suffers. I just don't have much in the way of patience for that sort of person."

I don't think I blame Hesse as much as the English translation that became popular in the 60s and contributed to the fucking ridiculous condescension towards Indian culture during that era.. The only female character in this book exists for sex & to birth a child & then die. Fuck off.. It's such a Christian-informed view of Buddhism/Hinduism/Jainism. Buddhism is NOT a skin to put on top of your Christian upbringing. It's a totally different way of looking at the world that Hesse clearly did not understand.. I want to write a counter book called ""Jesus: Or How Some Dude Named Jesus Who Was Around At The Same Time as Jesus Asked God, 'Yo Man, How Do You Not Run Out of Space in Heaven?'""

This book may be a food for your thoughts, for your soul! It will tell you the story of a man's journey towards seeking the truth, conquering the self! Siddhartha, son of a Brahmin, wanted to find the source of redemption within his self, from yearning, sufferings, desiring, to attain nirvana!. No spoilers! To know what he discovers, read the book! It may take time to comprehend some lines, some philosophies of the book while reading. I took time! Tried to grab the essence, don’t know how much I could!. If you're eager and ready to know about his journey, which may help you to discover many realizations about our life, may help you to look there with a different perspective, where individualism bends with the collectivism, you should read this book!"

Hesse's philosophy, or at least the philosophy he is championing in this book, is not for me. I find the basis of this philosophy unappealing and unconvincing. Believers can easily dismiss me as not having the spiritual depth to understand it -- so be it. This is not the place to argue it, but I have my own reasons to discard this way of thinking.. Setting the philosophy aside, just the story telling also seemed very weak to me. I do not know if that is a result of the translation or if it is in the original text. I was mesmerized by the magical language and atmosphere of The Glass Bead Game, but I could not find that lyricism or the magic in this book.. Overall, I finished this book underwhelmed, and disappointed."

What the writer meant when kamala( her love) says "" people of our sort are never meant to be loved""??. Whats the relation of Govinda with Sidharata ? its the say same like the women she loved?. If it all were a spiritual journey from embankment of feeling ,at the end why Siddhartha was most weak towards his son?. Can wisdom be transferred from teacher to student ?.

As per my perception, some parts were truth, some weird and some over- exertions that are so fashionable now-a-days. Another authors to have written on this material whom I have been fortunate enough to read are Khalil Gibran and Paulo Coelho. I place this book somewhere between those two writers. Coelho many a times seem repetitive and superfluous, Gibran almost never so. Perhaps because of the number of words used. I place Heese's Siddhartha soemhwere between. Overflowing and content organisation to please many readers isn't easy for such a book, and I think a good job has been done here with it. But I will definitely need to read it once more after a few months to be able to write a proper review."

But, this book was adventurous in a way that I could tolerate reading (listening). It follows a story of man who is on the pursuit to discover himself and falls into material happiness, gambling, drinking and all that only to be redeemed by a Ferryman who teaches him the Power of the River (Nature).. Books such as these are supposed to be life changer kinda books but the book remained with me for a very short time and then it became a story and then it became blurry.. Ofcourse, it is loaded with wise dialogues and the kind of wisdom that only poetic well crafted prose can enlighten."

I am suspicious of re-reads these days, because I am worried that I may not like a book as much as I liked it when I read it the first time. So, I was worried when I started reading 'Siddhartha'. But the book moved me as deeply as it did when I read it the first time. I saw new meanings and depth in the book, which I didn't see before. I have become older and wiser since the last time I read the book, but I am glad that the book has aged well with me and in some ways better than me."

Such books are not my type, so I didn't like it. I read fantasy, love stories, dramas, historical books, but phylosophy is not my type. I read it because when I was teen I was very interested in Hinduistic culture, collected everything I could find, at home dressed in Hindian women clothes (saris), but that book wasn't what I expected to be, so I got disappointed. Maybe I was too young for such book... You must get older to understand such books. I'm just still too young."

It solves many questions I've had for a long time, brought me a lot of ""wow, that's the way thing should be explained"" moments. I don't think it's a book to recommend to anyone, as it's like what Siddhartha told Govinda about finding and searching. I won't also categorize the book as religion or spirituality or philosophy, and certainly I don't think the label 'novel' fits it.

This is the story of Siddhartha who begins the journey to enlightenment by forging a spiritual transcendence on his own terms, not someone else's doctrine. And isn't that the condition of the contemporary life? Looking at others for answers that can be found deep within ourselves? Read this book."

Saddened because Siddhartha's search was not complete until he had attempted five paths.. Uplifted because he did complete it.. I both read on Kindle and listened on Audible to this book.

Siddhartha teaches us all that by always looking for perfection we miss the little things, the spontaneous beauty, the life-changing experiences. One of the things I learned from this book is that we can't control other people's fates —we must let things happen and go. We cannot impose our beliefs, we must remain open. Only experience will teach people and let them grow —we cannot put ourselves in others' path."

Maybe 20 years earlier I would have been impressed with the message hidden in this easy story of Buddhism... but Taoism speaks more to me spiritually. I liked that Hesse stresses the importance of abandoning the ego, for that is crucial to growth and development as well as benevolence and contentment. But the story itself was really cheesy. Maybe we know so much more now that this has inevitably fallen victim to time and simply become s cliche."

After all, they were born to live on dry land, not in water. Nor, of course, do they want to think. They weren’t made to think, but to live! It’s true, and anyone who makes thinking his priority may well go far as a thinker, but when all’s said and done he has just mistaken water for dry land, and one of these days he’ll drown.’. ==========. Once, when we had been discussing so-called acts of cruelty in the Middle Ages, he said to me: ‘What we think of as acts of cruelty are in reality nothing of the kind. Someone from the Middle Ages would still find the whole style of our present-day life abhorrent, but cruel, horrifying and barbaric in a quite different way. Every age, every culture, every ethos and tradition has a style of its own, has the varieties of gentleness and harshness, of beauty and cruelty that are appropriate to it. Each age will take certain kinds of suffering for granted, will patiently accept certain wrongs. Human life becomes a real hell of suffering only when two ages, two cultures and religions overlap. Required to live in the Middle Ages, someone from the Graeco-Roman period would have died a wretched death by suffocation, just as a savage inevitably would in the midst our civilization. Now, there are times when a whole generation gets caught to such an extent between two eras, two styles of life, that nothing comes naturally to it since it has lost all sense of morality, security and innocence. A man of Nietzsche’s mettle had to endure our present misery more than a generation in advance. Today, thousands are enduring what he had to suffer alone and without being understood.’. ==========. However, just as there are people prone to develop a temperature whenever they have the slightest ailment, those we call ‘suicide cases’, by nature always sensitive and highly strung, tend to react to the mildest distress by giving serious consideration to suicide.. ==========. As he grew accustomed to the idea that an emergency exit from life was always to hand, it gave him strength, made him curious to experience painful and wretched conditions to the full. And occasionally, when his life was a real misery, he might take a kind of perverse and grim delight in gleefully feeling: ‘Why not go on? I’m curious to see just how much a human being can bear! Once I reach the limit of what is bearable, all I need to do is open the door and I’ll have escaped it all.’ Very many suicide cases derive extraordinary strength from this idea.. ==========. Now, what we call ‘the bourgeois’ is an ever-present aspect of the human condition. It is nothing more than an attempted compromise, a striving for a balanced middle ground between the countless extremes and binary opposites of human behaviour. If we take any one of these binary opposites as an example, say that of the saint and the profligate, the sense of our metaphor will be immediately apparent. It is possible for human beings to devote themselves totally to things spiritual, to aspire to something approaching the divine, the ideal of sainthood. Conversely, they may devote themselves totally to their carnal urges, the demands of their senses, investing all their energy in the pursuit of instant gratification. One of these routes leads to the saint: the martyr to things spiritual, self-surrender to God. The other leads to the profligate: the martyr to carnal urges, self-surrender to corruption of the flesh. Members of the bourgeoisie will typically try to lead a life in the temperate zone between the two. They will never surrender themselves, never devote themselves either to dissipation or to asceticism. They will never be martyrs, never acquiesce in their own destruction; on the contrary: their ideal is not self-surrender but self-preservation. Neither sanctity nor its opposite is the goal they strive for; for them absolute goals are intolerable. They do wish to serve God, but they also give Bacchus his due, and although they want to be virtuous they are not entirely averse to earthly pleasures and creature comforts. In short, they attempt to put down roots midway between two extremes, in a bland and temperate zone without strong winds and rainstorms. Their attempt succeeds too, yet at the expense of all those intense experiences and emotions that only a life devoted to absolute and extreme goals can afford. Intensity of life is only possible at the expense of self. But there is nothing members of the bourgeoisie value more highly than self, albeit only at a rudimentary stage of development. Thus, at the expense of intensity, they manage to preserve their selves and make them secure. Instead of possession by God, an easy conscience is the reward they reap; instead of desire, contentment; instead of liberty, cosiness; instead of life-threatening heat, an agreeable temperature. Members of the bourgeoisie are therefore essentially creatures weak in vital energy, timid individuals, afraid ever to abandon themselves, easy to govern. That is why they have replaced power by majority rule, replaced force by the rule of law, and replaced responsibility by the ballot box.. ==========. Only humour – the splendid invention of those highly talented but unfortunate individuals who are frustrated in the pursuit of the highest ideals, figures bordering on the tragic – only humour (possibly the most original and brilliant of humankind’s achievements) can accomplish the otherwise impossible feat of uniting all spheres of human life by bathing them in the iridescent light of its prisms. To live in the world as though it were not the world, to respect the law but to remain above it, to have possessions ‘as if not possessing’, to renounce things as though it were no renunciation: – all the things asked of us in such well-loved and frequently expressed words of wisdom can only be put into practice through humour.. ==========. And whenever it begins to dawn on specially talented and highly strung souls that they have multiple selves, when they, like every genius, see through the delusion of the unified personality and feel themselves to be multifaceted, a bundle of many selves, they only need to assert the fact for the majority to lock them up on the spot. Scientific experts called in to help will diagnose schizophrenia, thus ensuring that the rest of humanity will never have to hear a cry of truth from the mouths of these unfortunate people.. ==========. The ‘human being’ of this convention is, like all bourgeois ideals, a compromise. It is a timid and naively cunning attempt to dodge the powerful demands of both the wicked primeval mother, nature, and the irksome primeval father, spirit, and to make one’s home in the lukewarm atmosphere of the middle ground between the two.. ==========. If Harry worships his favourites among the Immortals, for example Mozart, it is because he is still seeing him through bourgeois eyes, tending to explain the composer’s consummate art, just as a schoolmaster would, in terms of highly specialized talent. He thus ignores Mozart’s commitment, his willingness to suffer, his indifference to all bourgeois ideals, and his ability to endure the kind of extreme isolation that transforms the bourgeois atmosphere surrounding those suffering in the process of becoming fully human into the much thinner, ice-cold air of the cosmos.. ==========. Oh no, human beings are always desperately mistaken and bound to suffer when they try to get ‘back to nature’. Harry can never fully become a wolf again, and if he did he would realize that even wolves are not simple and primitive creatures but complex and many-sided.. ==========. Just imagine a garden with hundreds of different trees, thousands of different flowers, hundreds of different fruits and herbs. Now, if the only botanical distinction the gardener knows is that between edible things and weeds, he will not know what to do with nine tenths of his garden. He will uproot the most enchanting flowers, fell the finest trees, or at any rate detest and frown upon them. This is just what Steppenwolf is doing with the thousand blooms in his soul. He is totally ignoring anything that doesn’t come under the heading of ‘human being’ or ‘wolf’. And there is no end to the things he counts as ‘human’! All things cowardly, vain, stupid and mean are classed as ‘human’ if only because they are not exactly wolf-like, just as all strong and noble qualities are attributed to the ‘wolf’ simply because Harry hasn’t yet managed to master them.. ==========. There was no consolation in my going, and no humour: I had taken leave of my former world – home, bourgeois respectability, morality, scholarship – just as a man with a stomach ulcer says goodbye to roast pork.. ==========. Come on, how can you say you’ve gone to a lot of trouble to make something of your life when you don’t even want to dance?’ ‘But what if I just can’t? I’ve never learned how to.’ She laughed. ‘But you have learned to read and write, haven’t you, and you’ve learned arithmetic; probably Latin and French too, all sorts of stuff like that? I bet you spent ten or twelve years at school, then quite possibly went to university into the bargain. For all I know, you may even have a doctorate and can speak Chinese or Spanish. You see? But you’ve never managed to spare a bit of time and money for a few dance lessons! There, I told you so!’ ‘It was my parents,’ I said, trying to justify myself. ‘They got me to learn Latin and Greek and all that stuff. But they never made me learn to dance; it wasn’t the fashionable thing to do in our family. My parents themselves never went dancing.’ She gave me a really icy look, full of disdain. Again I saw something in her face that reminded me of the earliest days of my youth. ‘I see, so it’s your parents who must take the blame! Did you also ask their permission to come to the Black Eagle tonight? Did you? They are long since dead, you say? Well then! If from sheer obedience to them you refused to learn to dance in your youth, that’s all right with me, though I don’t believe you were such a model son back then. But what about afterwards, what did you get up to in all the years afterwards?’. ==========. However, the principal insight of that ancient body of knowledge, the fact that time was unreal, had so far escaped the notice of technicians. Of course, it too would eventually be ‘discovered’ and engineers would put their eager fingers to work on the problem. They would, perhaps very soon, discover that we are not only constantly surrounded by a flood of current, present-day images and happenings – in the way that now makes it possible to hear music from Paris or Berlin in Frankfurt or Zurich – but that everything that has ever happened is recorded and available in precisely the same way. With or without wires, with or without interfering noises off, we would one day no doubt be able to hear King Solomon or Walther von der Vogelweide speaking.8 And, just like the beginnings of radio today, all this would, I said, only serve to make human beings surround themselves with an ever-more dense network of distraction and pointlessly fevered activity, thus deserting their true selves and destiny.. ==========. But listen, I’m a musician, not a scholar, and I don’t believe that being right is of the slightest value where music is concerned. With music, it’s not a matter of being right, or of taste and education and all that.’ ‘Fair enough. But what is it matter of, then?’ ‘It’s a matter of making music, Herr Haller, making music as well, as much and as intensively as possible! That’s the point, Monsieur. I can have the complete works of Bach and Haydn in my head and be able to say extremely clever things about them, but that’s of no use to anybody. However, when I pick up my horn and play a brisk shimmy, regardless of whether it’s a good or a bad dance tune, it’s going to bring joy to people by putting a spring in their step and getting into their bloodstream. That’s the only thing that matters. Next time you are in a dance hall, just take a look at people’s faces at the moment when the music starts up again after a longish break. You’ll see their eyes beginning to sparkle, their legs starting to twitch, and their faces beaming brightly! That’s the point of making music.’ ‘All very well, Herr Pablo, but music aimed at the senses isn’t the only kind. There’s music of the spirit and mind too. Nor is there only the music that people just happen to be playing at a given moment. There’s also immortal music, music that lives on even though it’s not currently being played. It’s possible for people lying alone in bed to bring back to life a tune from the Magic Flute or the Matthew Passion in their heads. Then you have music taking place without a soul blowing on a flute or bowing a violin.’ ‘Certainly, Herr Haller. “Yearning” and “Valencia”10 are also silently reproduced every night by lots of lonely and wistful people. Even the poorest of girls sitting typing in her office has the latest one-step going through her head and taps the keys to its rhythm. You are right, there are all these lonely people and as far as I’m concerned they are welcome to their silent music, whether it be “Yearning”, the Magic Flute or “Valencia”. But where do all these people get their solitary, silent music from? They get it from us musicians. It first has to have been played and heard and has to have got into the bloodstream before anyone can think or dream of it in the privacy of their home.’ ‘Agreed,’ I said coolly. ‘Nevertheless, you can’t go putting Mozart and the latest foxtrot on one and the same level. And it does make a difference whether the music you play to people is divine and ageless or the cheap variety that only lasts a day.’ Noticing from the sound of my voice how worked up I was, Pablo immediately put on his kindest expression, tenderly stroked my arm and adopted an incredibly gentle tone of voice. ‘Ah, my dear man, what you say about different levels may well be right. I certainly don’t mind you situating Mozart and Haydn and “Valencia” on any level that suits you. It’s all the same to me. It’s not for me to decide on levels, that’s not something I’m asked to judge upon. People may still be playing Mozart in a hundred years’ time, whereas in two years from now they will perhaps already have stopped playing “Valencia”. I think that’s something we can safely leave to the dear Lord to decide. He has control of all our lifespans, even those of every waltz and foxtrot, and, since he is just, he will surely do what is right. But we musicians have to do our bit by carrying out the duty assigned to us. That means we must play whatever people desire at the moment and must play it as well, as beautifully and as forcefully as we possibly can.’. ==========. ‘You had an image of life in your head, a faith, a challenge. You were prepared to do great things, to suffer, to make sacrifices – and then bit by bit you noticed that the world wasn’t demanding great deeds, sacrifices and the like from you at all; that life wasn’t an epic poem with heroic roles and that kind of thing, but more like the parlour of a conventional household where the inhabitants are perfectly content to eat, drink coffee, knit stockings, play cards and listen to music on the radio.. ==========. And the subject they call “World History” in schools and the things you have to learn off by heart in them in order to be educated – all those heroes, geniuses, great deeds and sentiments – is just a confidence trick devised by the schoolteachers for the purposes of education and to give the children something to keep them occupied during the prescribed years of schooling.. ==========. That night of the ball I experienced a sensation which, though familiar to any teenage girl or student, I had not known the like of in all my fifty years. I mean the thrill of a party, the exhilaration that comes from celebrating with others, the mystery of losing one’s identity in the crowd, the unio mystica of joy. I had often heard people talk about it, there wasn’t a servant girl who hadn’t experienced it, and I had frequently seen the gleam in the eyes of those describing it. My response had always been a half supercilious, half envious smile. In the course of my life I must have witnessed that gleam a hundred times: in the eyes of people deep in drunken reverie or freed from all self-restraint; in the semi-deranged smile of someone utterly carried away, absorbed in the euphoric mood of a crowd. I had seen both noble and ignoble instances of it: on the faces of drunken recruits and naval ratings, for example, just as much as those of great artists, say, enthusiastically taking part in performances at a festival, and not less on those of young soldiers going to war. Even very recently I had admired, adored, mocked and envied such a gleam in the eyes and faraway smile on the face of my friend Pablo when, blissfully carried away by the excitement of playing in the band, he was bending over his saxophone or watching the conductor, the drummer or the banjo player with rapt and ecstatic attention. There were times when I had thought it possible only for really young people or nations which didn’t permit individuals to stand out"
11/04/2021,b12,r3895,79135925,Mike,"Mar 15, 2020",5,"For those with enough patience, “Steppenwolf” is one of the most insightful novels I have read on the male human condition.. I caution with the patience caveat because parts of this book are certain to make your eyes glaze over. Like all manifestos crafted by brilliant thinkers, the amount of introspection and judgment gets a little too fine and exhaustive at several points. But if you can push past this defect and the author’s unabashed self-centeredness, this is inarguably a brilliant work about personal growth and self-discovery, learning to overcome one’s inner-demons, and the power of love and deep connection to heal and keep us young, vibrant, and creative.. Written in the late 1920s, this book was well ahead of its time as many of the themes Hesse tackles fit with the M.O. of a writer from the 60s or 70s rather than the pre-WWII era. Most definitely one of my most interesting reads so far!. Rather than rehashing a plot summary, here’s some of my favorite quotes:. “As a body everyone is single, as a soul never.”. “There is no reality except the one contained within us. That is why so many people live such an unreal life. They take the images outside of them for reality and never allow the world within to assert itself.”. “Time and the world, money and power belong to the small people and shallow people. To the rest, to the real men belongs nothing...eternity...it isn't fame. Fame exists in that sense only for the schoolmasters. No, it isn't fame. It is what I call eternity...The music of Mozart belongs there and the poetry of your great poets. The saints, too, belong there, who have worked wonders and suffered martyrdom and given a great example to men. But the image of every true act, the strength of every true feeling, belongs to eternity just as much, even though no one knows of it or sees it or records it or hands it down to posterity. In eternity there is no posterity...It is the kingdom on the other side of time and appearances. It is there we belong. There is our home. It is that which our heart strives for...And we have no one to guide us. Our only guide is our homesickness.”. “A wild longing for strong emotions and sensations seethes in me, a rage against this toneless, flat, normal and sterile life.”. “The mistaken and unhappy notion that a man is an enduring unity is known to you. It is also known to you that a man consists of a multitude of souls, of numerous selves. The separation of the unity of the personality into these numerous pieces passes for madness. Science has invented the name schizomania for it. Science is in this so far right as no multiplicity maybe dealt with unless there be a series, a certain order and grouping. It is wrong insofar as it holds that one only and binding lifelong order is possible for the multiplicity of subordinate selves. This error of science has many unpleasant consequences, and the single advantage of simplifying the work of the state-appointed pastors and masters and saving them the labors of original thought. In consequence of this error many persons pass for normal, and indeed for highly valuable members of society, who are incurably mad; and many, on the other hand, are looked upon as mad who are geniuses...This is the art of life. You may yourself as an artist develop the game of your life and lend it animation. You may complicate and enrich it as you please. It lies in your hands. Just as madness, in a higher sense, is the beginning of all wisdom, so is schizomania the beginning of all art and all fantasy.”. “A girl had bidden me eat and drink and sleep, and had shown me friendship and had laughed at me and had called me a silly little boy. And this wonderful friend had talked to me of the saints and shown me that even when I had outdone myself in absurdity I was not alone.”. “That is why we were drawn to one another . . . I am going to teach you to dance and play and smile, and still not be happy. And you are going to teach me to think and to know and yet not be happy.”. “Harry, the thinker, is a hundred years old, but Harry, the dancer, is scarcely half a day old. It’s he we want to bring on, and all his little brothers who are just as little and stupid and stunted as he is.”. “She seemed to know more of life than is known to the wisest of the wise. It might be the highest wisdom or the merest artlessness. It is certain in any case that life is quite disarmed by the gift to live so entirely in the present, to treasure with such eager care every flower by the wayside and the light that plays on every passing moment.”. “She stood a moment before my eyes, clearly and painfully, loved and deeply woven into my destiny; then fell away again in a deep oblivion, at a half regretted distance.”"
11/04/2021,b12,r3896,62233839,Veta,"Jun 23, 2018",4,"[4.5]. I'm not sure what I expected from this book. A sort of philosophising trip? It certainly played that part well. The writing was exquisite and perfectly encapsulated Harry's internal conundrum.. However, his conflict with his misplacement in civil society pertains to a specific gaze, that of the middle class white male. To some degree, Hesse was aware of this gaze (he was acutely aware of his class, but ignorant of race and sex). His descriptions of Jazz, Negroes (""primitive"" and ""vacant eyes""), Jews (somewhat subtle anti-semitism) and depictions of women were products of the novel's unenlightened breadth. Hermine, as well as Maria and any other female appearances, were objects in this story. There is hardly any other way to describe them. I am aware that my own privileges in life enable me to be able to contextualise the ignorance and to be aware of the problems in the novel, without it deterring me from finding joy in both the novel itself and the pursuant analysis. I am only stating the problems I noticed because I don't want to feign ignorance of the harms of these evils.. I was still able to enjoy the majority of this book despite careful consideration of the fundamental biases that infiltrated the philosophy of this novel. Hesse has a way with words and there were some incredibly insightful and profound moments. I think I would like to read some critiques of this novel to further engage with what Hesse attempted to achieve.. To me, this book felt like an indictment of Harry, the eponymous Steppenwolf. The novel attempts to poke fun at the lens which Harry tries to unravel his internal war. His disconnect from society, from the experiences of pleasure or pain, was subtle parody on the intellectual asceticism, which denounces popular culture, for a culture more pure, more eternal and supposedly transcendent of space and time. Harry is his own paradox who perpetuates the things that disgust and separate him from society. The philosophical basis of this book anchored me with interest and I couldn't help but enjoy this experience. Definitely one that I would love to return to in the future.. Quotes. This Steppenwolf of ours has always been aware of at least the Faustian two-fold nature within him. He has discovered that the one-fold of the body is not inhabited by a one-fold of the soul, and that at best he is only at the beginning of a long pilgrimage towards this ideal harmony. He would either like to overcome the wolf and become wholly man or to renounce mankind and at last to live wholly a wolf's life. It may be presumed that he has never carefully watched a real wolf. Had he done so he would have seen, perhaps, that even animals are not undivided in spirit. With them, too, the well-knit beauty of the body hides a being of manifold states and striving. The wolf, too has his abysses. The wolf, too, suffers. No, back to nature is a false track that leads nowhere but to suffering and despair. Harry can never turn back again and become wholly wolf, and could he do so he would find that even the wolf is not of primeval simplicity, but already a creature of manifold complexity. Even the wolf has two, and more than two, souls in his wolf's breast, and he who desires to be a wolf falls into the same forgetfulness as the man who sings: ""If I could be a child once more!"" He who sentimentally sings of blessed childhood is thinking of the return to nature and innocence and the origin of things, and has quite forgotten that these blessed children are beset with conflict and complexities and capable of all suffering.. There is, in fact, no way back either to the wolf or to the child. From the very start there is no innocence and no singleness. Every created thing, even the simplest, is already is already guilty, already multiple. It has been thrown into the muddy stream of being and may never more swim back again to its source.. Before all else I learned that these playthings were not mere idle trifles invented by manufacturers and dealers for the purposes of gain. They were, on the contrary, a little or, rather, a big world, authoritative and beautiful, many sided, containing a multiplicity of things all of which had the one and only aim of serving love, refining the senses, giving life to the dead world around us, endowing it in a magical way with new instruments of love, from powder and scent to the dancing show, from ring to cigarette case, from waist-buckle to handbag. This bag was no bag, this purse not purse, flowers no flowers, the fan no fan. All were the plastic material of love, of magic and delight. Each was a messenger, a smuggler, a weapon, a battle cry.. For the first time I understood Goethe's laughter, the laughter of the immortals. It was a laughter without an object. It was simply light and lucidity. It was that which is left over when a true man has passing through all sufferings, vices, mistakes, passion and misunderstanding of men and got through to eternity and the world of space. And eternity was nothing else than the redemption of time, its return to innocence, so to speak, and its transformation again into space."
11/04/2021,b12,r3897,40751786,8314,"Jul 19, 2020",3,"Born as a dickless homo sapien this book gives me peculiar irritation. In page 50 or so I began to jokingly wonder if the so-called “bliss” the protagonist experienced was nutting. There’s a possibility, I thought, but given the experience seems to be Platonic it’s better not to take this possibility seriously. After all, I couldn’t just throw “you think and write with your penis” at Plato’s face. Hesse might be a prick that deserves an enantiodromia in the form of carnivalesque roasting (as I’m doing right now) but what has Plato done to deserve this? Plato deserves period. Period.. Fast forward to page 180-ish, oh fuck that “bliss” is totally nutting.*. I’m still not throwing that sentence at Plato’s face, but this diagnosis just makes Hesse look miserable. He’s officially one of those vocation-wannabes. Vocation, as understood in Christian theological context. ** There’s really no Calling for Haller or nothing Genuine about his existence. Gaslighting the reader with character description such as “he’s one step short from becoming the immortals” or ”he’s on the track of what is great and eternal” cannot make up the fact that it’s a total wishful thinking and self-aggrandizing. He’s far, far from it.. Literally what kind of “artist and a thinker” is this Harry dude, when he has no work to show? All he has is second-hand mob words, recycled ideas and hell of a cliche (almost tempted to say “German bourgeois”) understanding of things — especially the understanding towards eternity. He might think he has “Kultur”, but all he offered, and all Hesse offered in this book, was “Zivilisation” trite. In solid German fashion.. Eternity isn’t about bliss, which is subject to the transient evaluation of pleasure v.s. displeasure. Nor is it subject to equally transient evaluations like shallow v.s. profound, small v.s. grand. “Time and the world, money and power belong to the small people and shallow people.” — those are eternal too, you snob.***. A snob, who’s read too much and understood too little, went nuts over the ecstasy of nutting and started doing coke. — Take away the veil of erudite-wannabe style, that’s the one line summary of. Steppenwolf.. —————————————————————————. * Jung once commented that in the typical German (male) mind, women are not exactly perceived as person but tools/stock-characters to satisfy certain functions.. Steppenwolf. is a specimen of this diagnosis: the character Hermine is not female in its nature, but the double image of a male Puer Aeternus Hermann. I have expected Hesse to be cliche; didn’t expect him to be. this. cliche.. ** Cue Cordelia Flyte from. Brideshead Revisited. for a simple explanation: “I hope I've got a vocation. ... It means you can be a nun. If you haven't a vocation it's no good however much you want to be; and if you have a vocation, you can't get away from it, however much you hate it.”. *** Speaking of which, there’s a cool as fuck troll in Chinese philosophy called Chuang Tzu. One day, when someone asked Chuang Tzu where they can find Tao (the ultimate truth-reason-understanding of all things and phenomena), Chuang Tzu replied: “Tao is everywhere.”. “Please be more specific.”. “Tao’s in the insects.”. “Really? Lowly creature as insects?”. “Tao’s in the bricks and tiles.”. “That’s even lower than insects.”. “Tao’s in pisses and shit.”. “...” (Gives WTF are you kidding me face.). “Well,” Chuang Tzu concluded, “you’re not asking the right question that’s touching the essence. If you want to check the quality of pork on wet market, the harder you press the meat the better you understand. So are your questions: as long as you stay vague, the valid answer to your question could be everything. Tao is everywhere, so are greatest truth/words.”"

Will definitely have to go back and re-read most of the ones of his I've already read, and the ones I've not yet read..

I allowed the spirit of an irresponsible man who chews and munches another's words in his mouth, and gives them out again undigested, to enter into me through my eyes. I absorbed a whole column of it.. 41: Who read by night above the Rhine the cloudscript of the drifting mists?. 47: He had learned a good deal of all that people of a good intelligence can, and was a fairly clever fellow. What he had not learned, however, was this: to find contentment in himself and his own life.. 53: For every strong man attains to that which a genuine impulse bids him seek.. 55: What was said above on the subject of suicides touches obviously nothing but the surface. It is psychology, and, therefore, partly physics. Metaphysically considered, the matter has a different and a much clearer aspect. In this aspect suicides present themselves as those who are overtaken by the sense of guilt inherent in individuals, those souls that find the aim of life not in the perfecting and molding of the self, but in liberating themselves by going back to the mother, back to God, back to the all. Many of these natures are wholly incapable of ever having recourse to real suicide, because they have a profound consciousness of the sin of doing so. For us they are suicides nonetheless; for they see death and not life as the releaser. They are ready to case themselves away in surrender, to be extinguished and to go back to the beginning.. 60: A man cannot live intensely except at the cost of the self.. 61-62: ... for all extreme individuation turns against itself, intent upon its own destruction. We see that he had in him strong impulses both to be a saint and a profligate; and yet he could not, owing to some weakness or inertia, make the plunge into the untrammelled realms of space. The parent constellation of the bourgeoisie binds him with its spell. This is his place in the universe and this his bondage. Most intellectuals and most artists belong to the same type. Only the strongest of them force their way through the atmosphere of the bourgeois earth and attain to the cosmic. The others all resign themselves or make compromises. Despising the bourgeoisie, and yet belonging to it, they add to its strength and glory; for in the last resort they have to share their beliefs in order to live. The lives of these infinitely numerous persons make no claim to the tragic; but they live under an evil star in a quite considerable affliction; and in this hell their talents ripen and bear fruit.. 66: For it appears to be an inborn and imperative need of all men to regard the self as a unit. However often and however grievously this illusion is shattered, it always mends again.. 71-72: As for the way to true manhood, the way to the immortals, he has, it is true, an inkling of it and starts upon it now and then for a few hesitating steps and pays for them with much suffering and many pangs of loneliness. But as for striving with assurance, in response to that supreme demand, towards the genuine manhood of the spirit, and going the one narrow way to immortality, he is deeply afraid of it. He knows too well that it leads to still greater sufferings, to proscription, to the last renunciation, perhaps to the scaffold, and even though the enticement of immortality lies at the journey's end, he is still unwilling to suffer all these sufferings and to die all these deaths. Though the goal of manhood is better known to him than to the bourgeois, still he shuts his eyes. He is resolved to forget that the desperate clinging to the self and the desperate clinging to life are the surest way to eternal death, while the power to die, to strip one's self naked, and the eternal surrender of the self bring immortality with them. When he worships his favorites among the immortals, Mozart, perchance, he always looks at him in the long run through bourgeois eyes. His tendency is to explain Mozart's perfect being, just as a schoolmaster would, as a supreme and special gift rather than as the outcome of immense powers of surrender and suffering, of his indifference to the ideals of the bourgeois, and of his patience under that last extremity of loneliness which rarefies the atmosphere of the bourgeois world to an ice-cold ether, around those who suffer to become men, that loneliness of the Garden of Gethsemane.. 75: Man designs for himself a garden with a hundred kinds of trees, a thousand kinds of flowers, a hundred kinds of fruit and vegetables. Suppose, then, that the gardener of this garden knew no other distinction than between edible and inedible, nine-tenths of this garden would be useless to him. He would pull up the most enchanting flowers and hew down the noblest trees and even regard them with a loathing and envious eye. This is what the Steppenwolf does with the thousand flowers of his soul. What does not stand classified as either man or wolf he does not see at all.. 128: It is certain in any case that life is quite disarmed by the gift to live so entirely in the present, to treasure with such eager care every flower by the wayside and the light that plays on every passing moment.. 146-7: Just as the gramophone contaminated the esthetic and intellectual atmosphere of my study and just as the American dances broke in as strangers and disturbers, yes, and as destroyers, into my carefully tended garden of music, so, too, from all sides there broke in new and dreaded and disintegrating influences upon my life that, till now, had been so sharply marked off and so deeply secluded. The Steppenwolf treatise, and Hermine too, were right in their doctrine of the thousand souls. Every day new souls kept springing up beside the host of old ones; making clamorous demands and creating confusion; and now I saw as clearly as in a picture what an illusion my former personality had been. The few capacities and pursuits in which I had happened to be strong had occupied all my attention, and I had painted a picture of myself as a person who was in fact nothing more than a most refined and educated specialist in poetry, music and philosophy; and as such I had lived, leaving all the rest of me to be a chaos of potentialities, instincts and impulses which I found an encumbrance and gave the label of Steppenwolf.. 155: None of us intellectuals is at home in reality. We are strange to it and hostile.. 172: You are much too exacting and hungry for this simple, easygoing and easily contented world of today. You have a dimension too many. Whoever wants to live and enjoy his life today must not be like you and me.. 192-3: An experience fell to my lot this night of the Ball that I had never known in all my fifty years, though it is known to every flapper and student - the intoxication of a general festivity, the mysterious merging of the personality in the mass, the mystic union of joy. ... today, on this blessed night, I myself, the Steppenwolf, was radiant with this smile. I myself swam in this deep and childlike happiness of a fairy tale. I myself breathed the sweet intoxication of a common dream and of music and rhythm and wine and women - I, who had in other days so often listened with amusement, or dismal superiority, to its panegyric in the ballroom chatter of some student. I was myself no longer. My personality was dissolved in the intoxication of the festivity like salt in water.. 236: And only then could the question arise whether, behind all that, there was anything personal, anything of my own, left over; or whether all that I had done and all its consequences were merely the empty foam of the sea and a meaningless ripple in the flow of what was over and done.. 246-7: It is time to come to your senses. You are to live and to learn to laugh. You are to learn to listen to the cursed radio music of life and to reverence the spirit behind it and to laugh at its distortions."
11/04/2021,b12,r3899,3564385,Rowland Pasaribu,"Jun 23, 2010",4,"HARRY HALLER, A MIDDLE-AGED INTELLECTUAL, moves into a lodging house in a medium-sized, generic town, which is never named. Despairing and melancholy, Harry feels himself to be “a wolf of the Steppes,” or “Steppenwolf,” adrift and alone in a world that is incomprehensible to him and offers him no joy. Steppenwolf recounts Harry’s pain and anxiety as he tries to overcome his crippling sense of dislocation and despair at the futility of humanity.. Harry is repulsed by the productive, organized, and diligent optimism of the bourgeoisie, or middle class. Even so, he is bewitched by its charms. Caught between the urges of his wolf-half and his man-half, Harry can neither completely disavow nor embrace a conventional way of life. He regularly contemplates committing suicide.. One night, while Harry walks unhappily through an old quarter of the city, he sees a sign over a door he has never noticed before. The sign reads “. MAGIC THEATER—ENTRANCE NOT FOR EVERYBODY. .” More letters reflected on the street spell out “. FOR MADMEN ONLY!. ” Harry cannot open the door, but a sign-bearer advertising the Magic Theater gives Harry a booklet entitled “Treatise on the Steppenwolf.” This booklet contains a precise description of the way Harry feels as a Steppenwolf. It speaks of a person who is half man and half wolf who hates the bourgeois lifestyle but who is also at the same time incapable of surrendering himself to the pleasure of the senses…. The publication of Steppenwolf in 1927 caused a scandal, as the novel’s candid accounts of the corrupt elements of a city disappointed readers who had become accustomed to Hesse’s highly spiritual works. Critics claimed that the novel was too obviously confessional, as it sprang out of a crisis in Hesse’s own life. He wrote the novel after the failure of his first marriage and the collapse of his brief second marriage. Indeed, Hesse, who was shy and had always felt most comfortable at home, had gone on something of a socializing rampage, frequenting the bars and dance halls of Zurich. He spent most of his days drinking alcohol and most of his nights writing self-pitying poems (written before, but published after, the publication of Steppenwolf). These poems, which offer a painfully honest record of Hesse’s alcoholism, suicidal tendencies, and sense of mental and physical estrangement, serve as interesting companion pieces to the novel.. By the end of 1926, Hesse abandoned his self-indulgent lifestyle and retired to the solitude of his country retreat in Switzerland. Hesse’s work fluctuated widely in popularity during his career and has continued to do so since. His outspokenly pacifist novels were vilified and banned in Nazi Germany but were celebrated after World War II. In America, the Beat generation of the 1950s and the hippies of the 1960s enthusiastically embraced Hesse’s blend of Eastern philosophy and existentialism. Today, Hesse is acknowledged as one of the most influential German authors of the twentieth century, and he is widely respected for fusing elements of philosophies from around the globe in his work. Hesse’s efforts earned him the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1946. He died in 1962 at his home in Switzerland.. Steppenwolf describes Harry Haller’s unusual, tragic condition. He is torn between two selves: a man-half who desires the respectability and comforts of bourgeois existence, and a wolf-half who scoffs at these vain, absurd desires. Although Hesse returns to this dichotomy throughout the novel, he also frequently dismisses it as overly simplistic and exaggerated. According to the “Treatise on the Steppenwolf,” the idea that Harry is composed of these two selves is useful in theory, but, like all such theoretical constructs, is ultimately unable to capture the complexity and richness of reality. According to the Treatise, “Harry consists of a hundred or a thousand selves, not of two.” Moreover, this is true not only in Harry’s case but is an inherent condition of mankind.. The idea of multiple identities is most fully explored in the Magic Theater at the novel’s close. Pablo speaks of the theater as a place in which to perform the dissolution of the personality. Behind one of the strange doors, a man closely resembling Pablo teaches Harry that the individual is comprised of innumerable selves that may be reconfigured in varying ways, like chess pieces. Drawing upon the Eastern ideas of reincarnation and transmigration of the soul into infinite bodies, and upon the psychoanalytic theories of Carl Jung, Hesse articulates a highly personal hypothesis of the multifaceted nature of the soul.. In her most intense and revealing discussion with Harry, on the day before the Fancy Dress Ball, Hermine emphasizes something she calls “eternity.” Eternity exists “at the back of time.” It is the realm of all the things that matter—works of genius by artists like Mozart, the strength and potency within all true feelings and acts, and the pure saints and suffering martyrs.. Hermine’s speech provides the clearest formulation of Hesse’s idea of such a world beyond time. Other figures in Steppenwolf refer to it in more or less straightforward terms; Goethe for instance, speaks of the mistake man commits in making too much of time. Indeed, the mere fact of Harry’s encounters with past geniuses points to their continuing existence in some realm freed from the mechanism of time. More subtly, the idea of existence beyond time crops up as a frequent sensation whenever Harry is operating correctly. Caught up in the collective dancing fervor at the ball, for instance, Harry says that he has “lost the sense of time.”. Since Steppenwolf is meant to be an educational text, Hesse develops the idea of a world beyond in tandem with his other major ideas in the novel. The laughter of the “immortals” is one way of entering into the world of eternity. Likewise, the failure to recognize the existence of multiple selves within the individual may be linked to an insufficient consciousness of timelessness. Indeed, when Harry looks into the gigantic mirror of the Magic Theater, he sees dozens of Harrys of all sizes, inclinations, and temperaments. One Harry even darts off impetuously before Harry’s astonished eyes. Being thus intertwined with the other major ideas of the novel, the existence of a space beyond time in a sense provides the soul of these ideas. Laughter may offer a way to confront life, but it is eternity that holds the key to the reason for doing so. Hesse suggests that our actions struggling on behalf of goodness and genius do matter in the large-scale view.. Harry’s profound attachment to music is obvious from the start, when the preface describes the curious changes that come over him at the symphony. Harry’s earliest and greatest idol is Mozart. Among Harry’s greatest frustrations with modern popular culture are the radio and gramophone, which he dislikes because he believes they defile sacred music. For Harry, music floats above the world of mundane realities, a perfect, transcendent sphere of the spiritual. This high estimation of music recalls German Romantic aesthetic theory, which prized music foremost among the arts because it does not attempt to represent something else, as visual or dramatic arts do. Strictly pure, divorced from having to picture or describe any physical thing, music seems to belong to the divine world beyond the visible one.. The motif of dancing operates alongside the motif of music. If music provides a sense of the immortal, lofty spiritual world, dancing suggests a tuning of earthly actions to the rhythms of the divine. Hermine teaches Harry to dance and at the same time teaches him how to combine physical and spiritual life. The fact that Pablo is a genius bandleader, choosing and directing the songs to which a multitude dances, reflects his gift for bringing the two parts of the self—the sensuous and the spiritual—into harmony."
11/04/2021,b12,r3900,7277996,Moonchild,"Feb 10, 2020",0,"Very good and pretentious. Those were the two opinions on Steppenwolf I heard before putting my hands on this book. The former, coming from someone I know well, served as an encouragement to read the book. The latter, heard from someone I barely knew, served as an encouragement to see where the pretentiousness was: in the book or that person. And although it took me three attempts to immerse myself entirely in those oneiric pictures, I ended up reading Hesse’s work twice.. Steppenwolf is a novel that tells the story of a middle-aged man, Harry Haller. Though Harry seems rather average, he does have an unusual quirk. He has two souls inhabiting his body: one of a human, and the other of a wolf. When Haller appears to have come to terms with the duality of his persona, he learns that there are far more than just two souls encapsulated within him.. The story excels at showing that we are all pretty incoherent beasts with complex souls and mutually exclusive desires. The many layers of ours not rarely provoke the feeling of going mad, as by satisfying one need, we sabotage the others, by honouring something, we dishonour something else. Those internal conflicts that occur constantly ironically make us all eligible guests to the ‘Madmen Only’ Magic Theater. Harry is no exception.. What adds to the internal confusion is the external world. This is because people around us choose to accept only one specific side to us, almost demanding from us to squish the others, while all we really want is to be accepted fully. Harry Haller achieves that the moment he meets Hermine – a woman he sees for the first time when at his worst. The story is old – a person on the verge of despair meets another person that becomes their saviour. She understands him like no one else, pays attention to his confessions without judging him and appears to share his darkest thoughts.. However, what he fails to acknowledge is the truth blatantly voiced by Hermine herself: what he appreciates so fiercely about her is actually… his own features projected onto her. This is the interesting part – projection, after all, happens when we fall in love, and the moment we recognize this phenomenon, the feeling can grow into mature love. But Hesse shows us possibly the most tragic consequences of not realizing that, and Harry is both the victim and the criminal.. The last pages are full of dream-like, hazy pictures as Hesse takes us to Harry’s deepest thoughts, furthest memories, greatest fears and truest truths about him and maybe about… all of us.. There is no doubt that Steppenwolf is “for madmen only”, but those make up a greater part of this world. And even though I’m running the risk of being not only insane but also pretentious, I’ll say it’s a very good book."
11/04/2021,b12,r3901,51271722,Wendy,"Jun 23, 2020",5,"“In eternity there is no time, only an instant long enough for a joke.”. I loved this acid-trip of a book when I first read it in 1968. Its skewering of everything bourgeois, its dark madness and pessimism, spoke directly to my teenage rebellious heart. Now, over 50 years later,. as someone in my 60's and closer to the eternal nothingness, its darkness and intelligence is a welcome companion.. “Solitude is independence. It had been my wish and with the years I had attained it. It was cold. Oh, cold enough! But it was also still, wonderfully still and vast like the cold stillness of space in which the stars revolve.”. Oh, my, Mr. Hesse. Yum.. And that this was published in 1927 just astonishes me. His immersion in Eastern philosophy, his dedication to finding release from material mediocrity, his pessimism about human nature, makes this book ridiculously delicious.. “The mistaken and unhappy notion that a man is an enduring unity is known to you. It is also known to you that a man consists of a multitude of souls, of numerous selves. The separation of the unity of the personality into these numerous pieces passes for madness. Science has invented the name schizomania for it. Science is in this so far right as no multiplicity maybe dealt with unless there be a series, a certain order and grouping. It is wrong insofar as it holds that one only and binding lifelong order is possible for the multiplicity of subordinate selves. This error of science has many unpleasant consequences, and the single advantage of simplifying the work of the state-appointed pastors and masters and saving them the labors of original thought. In consequence of this error many persons pass for normal, and indeed for highly valuable members of society, who are incurably mad; and many, on the other hand, are looked upon as mad who are geniuses...This is the art of life. You may yourself as an artist develop the game of your life and lend it animation. You may complicate and enrich it as you please. It lies in your hands. Just as madness, in a higher sense, is the beginning of all wisdom, so is schizomania the beginning of all art and all fantasy."". This book is about bringing about the death of personality, the death of identity, and the death of the endless repetitive living of a thoughtless life. Some of us yearn for these deaths. There was never a better book about the longing for going ""home"" into the vastness of no differentiation.. ""In eternity there is no posterity...It is the kingdom on the other side of time and appearances. It is there we belong. There is our home. It is that which our heart strives for...And we have no one to guide us. Our only guide is our homesickness.”. Brilliant book."
11/04/2021,b12,r3902,3682119,Gabriel Avocado,"Jan 21, 2019",4,"i quite enjoyed this book in the way i interpreted. in the introduction, hesse complains that this is his most misunderstood book but there are parts where characters essentially look directly at the camera and tell you what hesse wants you to think, which is par for the course for turn of the century literature i suppose, and it didnt really ruin it for me either (i rather liked those moments if im honest).. this book is about harry haller, the steppenwolf, and his various adventures as a misanthrope. he hates others but hates himself the most and constantly toes a narrow balance between respectable old man and mad animal ready to rip others apart. from what i understood, steppenwolf is about how boring and hypocritical bourgeois society is. haller rejects it out of hand but here is one of my issues with the book.. despite hallers objection to the first world war and his hatred of capitalism, he finds the bourgeoisie bad not because it is parasitic or exploitative but because it is phony. haller cant stand that he sees right through the phony nature of bourgeois society yet he longs to live among them regardless. he is a steppenwolf because he belongs to their class yet rejects it.. really, now. this is just catcher in the rye isnt it.. im being a little sarcastic here but i really want to point out how poignant and touching this book can be on the topic of loneliness and alienation. hallers fear of others is so familiar that it felt like hesse stole my journal entries and used them for his novel. his thoughts on suicide as well were so breathtaking i had to put the book down several times. i really need to stress that if you feel suicidal you should probably avoid this one, not because its particularly triggering but steppenwolf has a tendency to make suicide look like a logical way out and it doesnt necessarily resolve that thought by the end of the book.. speaking of the end, after he meets hermine, things take strange turns that arent necessarily unpleasant but the somewhat fantastical elements of the tale werent as entertaining as a heightened reality where a man lived a very sad and lonely existence with a beautiful woman who also sought death some day. its a minor gripe with the book and the whole thing seems to be leading up to it and im sure hesse would say to me, if he were alive, that i just didnt get it, but sure, whatever. i never wont a nobel prize in literature so what do i know.. im giving this four stars because i liked it quite a lot but i dont recommend it for everyone (see above for the extra caveat). its a very fast read regardless but theres a great deal of substance on loneliness under capitalism in here that i got a lot out of."
11/04/2021,b12,r3903,6423134,Bernie Gourley,"May 29, 2017",5,"Harry Haller lives out-of-step with virtually every aspect of modern society. He finds the prevailing music, art, and entertainment to be trivial and low-brow. He has pacifist tendencies amid strongly nationalist peers. This disjoint between his individual nature and society’s has made him depressed to the point of being suicidal—but he hasn’t been able to bring himself to commit the act, and has instead given himself a deadline.. Enter Hermione (note: her name seems to be rendered “Hermine” in some editions), a woman who is in many ways the exact opposite of Haller. She loves Jazz, enjoys dancing, and doesn’t like to be too serious or analytical about anything. She becomes his Yoda. She teaches him to dance, introduces him to a lover, and exposes him to the delights of frivolity. While the book opens in a way that makes one think it might be an indictment of modern society, what it really shows is how Haller’s unhappiness comes from insisting that society should be fitted to his worldview and proclivities. If he can find a way to get beyond that insistence, he can transcend his unhappiness.. One of the fascinating intrigues of the book is that Hermione early on promises that she will get Haller to do two things: fall in love with her and something else which I’ll leave to the reader but which seems even more unfathomable. This sets up an intense tension that one eagerly follows through the rest of the book. (It’s not so surprising that Haller will fall for Hermione. That seems to happen immediately. Still, you’ll remember that I pointed out that Hermione played cupid and set Haller up with her friend Maria, so it’s fascinating that she intends to make him fall in love with her.). The organization of the book is a bit unconventional, but it works both in terms of being easy to follow and in providing a multi-dimensional story. (Though if one missed the first part on wouldn’t be at a terrible loss.) The first part is an “Editor’s Preface” as told by the nephew of Harry Haller’s landlady. He comes into possession of Haller’s manuscript and explains what it is that made him go to the trouble of publishing it, despite—as he tells us—he ordinarily would not. It explains how this man’s limited interaction with Haller intrigued him and made him want to tell the story. The second part is labeled “Harry Haller’s Notebooks (for mad people only),” and is from Haller’s perspective. This section shows us a depressed Haller walking the streets and railing against the futility of the world when his attention is captured by a sign for a theater that announces: “Admission not for everybody. For mad people only.” From that point we enter the story itself, which is entitled “On Steppenwolf: A Tract (for mad people only.)”. The novel gets bizarre / surreal at the end as Haller is going through his “Magic Theater” experience. One doesn’t know exactly what is real, what is hallucinogen-induced, and what flows from madness. However, this warped reality works well for a story of transcendence and transformation.. I’d recommend this book for readers generally. It’s short, readable, has intriguing characters, and is thought-provoking. If you like stories that make you think, you’ll enjoy this book."
11/04/2021,b12,r3904,15620385,Jiwesh Kushal,"Apr 05, 2021",5,"This is a gripping story of the social recluse, Harry Haller, who struggles to find a deeper meaning to live for. The thoughts and temptations of the protagonist are a manifestation of the experiences of the author at the time of writing. This gives the story a rawness that is as much unsettling as it is engrossing.. The first one-third of the book is about the isolated life of the protagonist. The author takes the liberty of introducing a neighbour to Harry possessed with a keen acumen for character analysis. The internal monologue of Harry as he roams around the streets at night, trying to find something. real. , something of value, too afraid to return to his residence where he'll be consumed by his destructive thoughts, is utterly captivating. He has chosen a life of intellect and arts, far removed from the carnal pleasures that the bourgeois (middle class) indulge themselves in day in, day out. To his utter disappointment, his life is just as hollow as the one he judges the bourgeois to be living. He had isolated himself from the crowd by striving for intellectual greatness, but all he has now is an unbearable agony of loneliness. A truly fascinating read.. I didn't find the final two-thirds nearly as gripping. It was the complete investment in the protagonist that carried me through it.. The author has lamented this view of the book in his postscript, written fourteen years after the publication of the original. Hesse says that readers, young and old, suffer along with Steppenwolf and dream his dreams along with him. However, they fail to appreciate the second, the higher, timeless realm existing above the problematic life of the protagonist, which constitutes the latter half of the book. I definitely and unashamedly fall into this category of people.. I cannot help but give five stars for the book even though I didn't like a good chunk of it as much. The rating is owed to parts that were simultaneously totally consuming and deeply unnerving. It makes you want to do nothing other than read the story, while also being terrified of it the entire time you do so. This is a book I'd probably shy away from recommending people I meet, but would sit and rave about the lines and the themes for hours with someone who has read the book and loved it."
11/04/2021,b12,r3905,53715993,Daphne,"Nov 01, 2020",4,"[Watch out - spoilers!]. Where do I begin? I had the feeling, while I was reading, that I was reading something special. But I'm pretty sure I barely understood it. To say I skimmed the surface would probably be being generous to me.. I'll be honest, the main reason I picked the book up was because I heard the word ""werewolf"" in connection with it and it's a classic.. I was beyond intrigued when I started reading. I read HH's note that, ""...it seems to me that of all my books, Steppenwolf is the one that was more often and more violently misunderstood than any other, and frequently it is actually the affirmative and enthusiastic readers, rather than those who rejected the book, who have reacted to it oddly."" I mean, what does that mean? What an enigmatic introduction to a book.. I really enjoyed the Preface, where we see Harry Haller from a third party perspective. I couldn't wait to read his records and see what it was all about.. And then I nearly gave up and DNF-ed. Harry Haller's records were pretty baffling to start with, but what really floored me was the Treatise on the Steppenwolf. It was so dense and abstract I just couldn't penetrate the language. Even when I finished the Treatise, I spend a significant next chunk of the book considering whether to give up. I kept going on the advice of a close and well-read friend, who told me to keep going because the book's quite short (I think she was focused on hitting her reading challenge at that point...) and it won the Nobel Prize for Literature, so there must be something to be gained from seeing it through. And I'm so glad I did!. Where I really started to get into it was when we enter the picaresque, Faustian end section with Pablo, Hermine and Maria (plus Mozart and Goethe, obviously...). I loved the madness and the horror and the absurdity. I loved eventually realising that it's Pablo who's the devil and the ringmaster. It was super and reminded me of The Master and Margarita, one of my all-time favourites.. So, apparently one common way this book has been understood is as a ""savage indictment of bourgeois society"". Others decry that and say the book is ""a plea for rigorous self-examination and an indictment of intellectual hypocrisy"". My view: was Harry Haller just going through a midlife crisis?. I think I'll definitely read this book again at some point, and probably come out with a wholly different interpretation. And I look forward to the fun of that! I think I'm also tempted to try another of HH's books, maybe Siddartha. Although I'm not expecting to understand much of that either."
11/04/2021,b12,r3906,72608109,Frank Privette,"Jan 15, 2019",2,"Picture the Steppenwolf: if Heathcliff had a lovechild with Christopher Nolan, forced it to shoot up Nietzsche, inhale Dostoevsky, and smoke up Kierkegaard for forty years, infused it with some good old fashioned Teutonic racism (see most of the passages about jazz, but there are many other unsurprising examples) and sent it to live in a comfortable urban German bed and breakfast to complain about its angst and brood over life’s meaning, you get a glimpse of the self-important dreariness one has to put up with while reading this book. To nobody’s surprise, there’s not much in terms of a disclosure as to how all of this is actually funded. But what evidence exists all points to the Steppenwolf owing a great deal to the institution constantly criticized during the novel: the loathed bourgeoisie.. No wonder this crybaby of a character was, as the blurb in my edition proudly states, “adopted by the sixties’ counterculture.” It makes perfect sense that the complaints of one privileged group (educated, middle class pre economic crisis 1920s Germany) would resonate with the “give me that, it’s mine” baby boomer culture.. Hermine is one of the prostitutes he meets along his “journey.” Apart from coming suspiciously close being the author’s namesake, she has the best insight in the novel when she tells the Steppenwolf: “I must say, Harry, you make me almost sorry for you. I never knew such a baby.” (She tells him that twice. Three times if you count “little boy”).. Again wise Hermine: “... I, my friend, am surprised that you are so disillusioned with life when you are at home with the deepest and most beautiful things, with spirit, art, and thought!” One can almost hear a Christopher Nolanesque soundtrack as we picture the gloomy, uncomprehended, poor, despairing, old soul.. Please.. The only reason this is not a one-star review is that at least it was not written by Paulo Coelho."

But then the book flat out tells you that this man/wolf dichotomy is an oversimplification and a delusion of Haller’s and the story goes in a different direction than you’re expecting. At some point I realized that I did not like or relate to Harry Haller anymore and found that he was really very pretentious and the source of his unhappiness seemed to be an unearned superiority complex plus an inability to find any merit in anything short of Mozart.. The big message of the book seems to be that you need to lighten up and learn to laugh at life- but the irony is that the “don’t take things so seriously” message takes itself waaaay too seriously- it preaches humor but is totally humorless. As another reviewer put it, it’s overwrought, desperately so. Harry needs to relearn the simple pleasures of eating food and having sex as if there’s something profound in that and most of the book is further hedonistic indulgence- doing drugs, having sex with young women, wild parties and dancing all night. Is that really good advice for a man going on fifty? In the beginning of the book he has trouble going up stairs. I’m sure for the time (1927) this was rather radical, but it isn’t practical.. I’m sure you could try to navigate the bizarre events and ramblings of the later part of this book to figure out the point or meaning behind it but the story is just not interesting enough to entice me to do so. I had to muscle through a lot of it."
11/04/2021,b12,r3908,4726103,Nigel,"Nov 11, 2012",4,"Herman Hesse, regarded as one of the 20th century's German greats, has held a place in my heart since my teens when I read his mediaeval classic, Narziss and Goldmund, which remains one of my favourite books. After his death in 1961 he underwent something of a revival as his ideas began suddenly to resonate with the hippie movement and beyond. He won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1946 after his ascetic and philosophically-founded epic The Glass Bead Game, which is heavy going and I've twice failed to complete.. Steppenwolf was written in 1927, and reached me as a Penguin Classic in 1974. Adorned with stills from a long-forgotten movie adaptation starring Max von Sydow and Dominique Sanda (how the era flashes back at the sound of those names), the clear gloss ConTact protection I'd lovingly stuck on it had served it well: it was pristine. At least on the surface. The pages had dulled to a romantic pale gold -- and in all this time had somehow happened to remain unread. Apt, then, that I come to it at roughly the same age as its protagonist, Harry Haller, a self-sentenced exile from society, disillusioned with its vacuous bourgeois pettinesses and numbed against any remaining impulse towards meaning. And it's the same for me. Or has been. So let's see Hesse's map for a mid-life crisis, thought I.. It's a dreamlike story (perhaps even consciously Surrealist given its period) propelled by regularly placed, rainbow-coloured, fairylike signals in the form of neon-ish letters appearing on Harry's nocturnal prowls, spelling intriguing invitations to a theatre 'for madmen only'. They seem personally directed at Harry himself, who, having reached a spiritual dead-end in daily life, is flirting with suicide, both desiring and fearing death -- for him an Einsteinian eternity liberated from time and space among the spirits of the Immortals -- and finds himself in a frustrated stasis which he blurs in drink. He's a distinguished-looking former writer, fighting a losing battle to stave off bitterness and judgementalism, all fuelled by an innate self-loathing the cause of which is never revealed, but is hinted to be Christianity. Handed a cheap booklet by a small, anonymous figure in the spirit of the man who gave Jack the beans, he's intrigued to discover between its covers a psychically accurate critique of his own imagined self, which is that he's possessed of two personalities that grapple for control of his body and soul: the man he is, and the spirit of a lonely, savage wolf from the Russian steppes -- the civilised versus the profane. The booklet opens his eyes to the oversimplicity of this self-appraisal, and arouses his curiosity as to what lies in store with the next such magical visitation.. His daylight existence offers little hope. He lodges with goodnatured but straitlaced people who stimulate him little, and an inability to escape a dinner-invitation from a former colleague leads to social disaster when he spits out his scorn before the meal is over. When the book was written, the First World War was still fresh in Europe's memory, and Hesse's very clear that seeds are being sown by the German ruling classes for the next. And noting that Harry Haller's initials match Hesse's own, I absorbed the book as an adventurous, barely disguised exercise in emotional self-healing on the author's part, any hint of self-indulgence evaporating under the luminous generosity of his imagination. Swept into his poetical love for the geniuses of the past whose strivings in art, particularly music, produced the eternal masterpieces which above all else sustain him, we share Harry's distaste for the society he longs to, but can't, escape. We also comprehend his suicidal hopelessness, since now that he's hit decaying middle-age, the possibility of self-reinvention seems remote.. But, in fact, it's not. Salvation arrives in the form of a divine young beauty in her twenties who not only understands Harry inside-out, but, against all odds, seduces him into the once-assumed-superficial world of sensuality that all his life he's dismissed as unworthy (at the cost, he discovers, of his happiness). But -- declares Hermine (her name another reflection of the author's own) -- she must exact a price. And from this moment the story takes us into the renowned decadence of the Berlin of the 20s, Teutonic counterpart of Gatsby's world in a way, but concerned in this instance less with the host than with the party as the art-form, and soaring into feverishness, horror and sexual ecstasy on a magic carpet of unspecified intoxicants. And all conveyed by the storyteller gently, frankly and without sensationalism in a spirit of psychic curiosity, as one might confide to a close friend their presence in a dream.. Hermann Hesse's voice is warm, kind and wise. He's a poet diligently devoted to the spiritual. For me, this is the most enriching type of writer, because such work, in looking towards inner horizons, seeks to express what unites us between birth and death, and offers empathy and companionship and sustenance. The atmosphere he creates has a gorgeousness that belongs to a period about which we have few first-hand accounts, and he makes the German 20s very present. It turns out that in almost a century, the phenomenon of the dance-party has changed barely a scintilla (except that then the music was live) and the surprise of this realisation served to reinforce for me the book's sense of universality. It's just so refreshing to read the imaginings of a mind within which, for this reader at least, burns such affinity, a voice from a long-dead past that sings as if in the same room, in the here and now. His observations and insights, alive with Jungian superawareness, resonate with a crystalline accuracy in the tone of a kindly brother. And to read an author who so vividly navigates such an earthly story across such spiritual waters is a rare thing, and my prevailing response was a glowing gratitude.. The book is like music, and while carefully structured, has an improvisational cheekiness which isn't always successful, but never less than enjoyable. Noting that 'all humour is gallows humour', he manages to create celebration from despair, and gives you his formula as he goes, because the characters, all facets of himself, tell you plainly what they're up to. And one of them, delightfully, is Mozart, immortal symbol of what seems to be the book's main theme: that hope and imagination, both sourced from the divine within us all, are just mirror reflections of each other."
11/04/2021,b12,r3909,55138321,Udit Vikhe,"Jan 03, 2021",5,"""Steppenwolf"" by Hermann Hesse is a novel which takes you by the hand and plunges into the depths of personality perception, spirituality and the richness of life in our world.. The protagonist of the book, Harry, believes that his personality is torn between that of a human being (everything that is good, responsible and mannered within him) and that of a wolf (everything which arises out of impulse and is considered devilish). Living in a state of spiritual dishevel, our protagonist chances upon Hermione, his personal saviour and soul sister, who understands his loneliness, his fears and the struggles in his life.. As the story progresses we encounter surreal descriptions painted by the author in colorful words providing the most satisfying artistic experience. New characters are thrown in the mix and our protagonist's involvement with them sheds light not only on his old personality but also on the changes occurring within him as he is forced to move out of his comfort zone.. The book deals with concepts like suicide, depression, spiritual degradation, personality perception, the sense of meaninglessness in life, suffering, healing, redemption, timelessness and the beauty of life in its myriad forms.. This book is for anyone who enjoys spiritual musings, is curious about the sense of self and questions the suffering in our life. A must read!"

""A man who can understand Buddha and has an intuition of the heaven and hell of humanity ought not to live in a world ruled by “common sense” and democracy and bourgeois standards."". Took nearly 10 days to finish reading this 256 pages of a rather thin book, that I could possibly be done with it in 5-6 hours. Though it is light in size, it has heavy content to digest and macerate completely in my subconscious mind. And I was quite scared and afraid of continuing to read this book. It has suicidal triggers in it. Even when I read passed it, it was like a vortex, trying to swallow me whole. Hence, I am not going to write a long review of it. Its brilliance has become a never-ending rabbit hole hyperrealistic experience for me and I'm kind of phobic addict to it. Have you cut yourself dry with a sharp paring knife and you're in deep pain, yet your eyes are transfixed to the wound? That's me now. Hesse marvellously did that.. ""There is no reality except the one contained within us. That is why so many people live such an unreal life. They take the images outside of them for reality and never allow the world within to assert itself."""
11/04/2021,b12,r3911,13280676,Stuart Woolf,"Jun 16, 2018",1,"This book was fucking unbearable to read.. I got to page 70, out of 200. Here’s what happens: some minor character describes the eccentricities of the protagonist for 20 pages, then the protagonist does the same for another 20 pages (there is also talk of suicide), then the protagonist receives a pamphlet written (it would seem) about himself, his eccentricities, and his melancholy, which takes up 30 pages.. The sentences are very long. Bored, I selected a sentence at random and counted the number of lines it occupied on the page. That randomly-selected sentence was 10 lines long. It was about the protagonist’s complex relationship with the bourgeois culture of his day. Every sentence is about that topic.. A few people I know (all male) really liked this book - as in, “changed my life” status. Admittedly, I didn’t get to the end, but I know the middle-aged protagonist has wild sex with a woman a lot younger than he is and has some kind of spiritual awakening from the experience. I guess I’m happy for him, I just wish they translated the title to “My Big, Fat, Boring Mid-Life Crisis.”"
11/04/2021,b12,r3912,4633930,Aina,"Nov 01, 2014",5,"This remarkable work of Herman Hesse tells a story of how Harry Haller's self-imposed internal conflict between the educated man and the wild wolf brings him a life of intellectual torture until at the end of it he meets his soul sister Hermine who forces him to see life differently with its simple pleasures of drugs, sex and other frivolities. My favorite passage from the book is where Harry is introduced to the reader through the eye of his middle-class flatmate . Not only this passage captures some traits of Harry's personality, but more importantly the insightful depiction of the society at that era, which, in my opinion, is quite true about the society of today.. ""Harry Haller … had a very fine leather suitcase, which made a good impression on me, and a big flat cabin trunk that showed signs of having traveled far - at least it was plastered with labels of hotels and travel agencies of various agencies of various countries, some overseas.. Then he himself appeared, and the time began during which I gradually got acquainted with this strange man. At first I did nothing to encourage it. Although Haller interested me from the moment I saw him I took no steps for the first or three weeks to run across him or to get into conversation with him. On the other hand I admit that, from the very first, I observed him a little; moreover, I went into his room now again when he was out and my curiosity drove me to do a little spy work.. I have already given some account of the Steppenwolf's outward appearance. He gave at the very first glance the impression of a significant, an uncommon, and unusually gifted man. His face was intellectual, and the abnormally delicate and mobile play of his features reflected a soul of extremely emotional and unusually delicate sensibility. When one spoke to him and he, as always the case, dropped conventionalities and said personal and individual things that come out of his own alien world, then a man like myself came under his spell on the spot. He had thought more than other men, and in matters of the intellect he had that clam objectivity, that certainty of thought and knowledge, as only really intellectual men have, who lack ambition, who never wish to shine, or to persuade others, or to appear always in the right.. I remember an instance of this in the last days he was here, if I can call a mere fleeting glance he gave me an example of what I mean. It was when a celebrated historian and art critic, a man of European fame, had announced a lecture in the university hall. I had succeeded in persuading the Steppenwolf to attend it, though at first he had little desire to do so. We went together and sat next to each other. When the lecturer ascended the platform and began his address, many of his listeners, who had expected a sort of a prophet, were disappointed by his rather spruce and conceited air. And when he proceeded, by way of introduction, to say a few flat erring things to the audience, thanking them for their attendance in such numbers, the Steppenwolf threw me a quick look, a look which criticized both the words and the entire personality of the speaker - an unforgettable and frightful look which spoke volumes! It was a look that did not simply criticized that lecturer, annihilating the celebrated man with its crushing yet delicate irony. That was the least of it. It was more sad than ironical; it was indeed utterly and hopelessly sad; it conveyed a quiet despair, born partly of conviction, partly of a mode of thought which had become habitual with him. This despair of his not only unmasked the conceited lecturer and dismissed with its irony the matter at hand, the expectant attitude of the public, the somewhat presumptuous title under which the lecture was announced - no, the Steppenwolf's look pierced our whole epoch, its whole overwrought activity, the whole surge and strife, the whole vanity, the whole superficial play of a shallow, opinionated intellectuality. And alas! the look went still deeper, went far below the faults, defects, and the hopelessness of our time, our intellect, our culture alone. It went right to the heart of all humanity, it bespoke eloquently in a single second the whole despair of a thinker, of one who perhaps knew the full worth and meaning of man's life. It said: 'See what monkeys we are! Look, such is man!' and at once all renown, all intelligence, all the attainments of the spirit, all progress towards the sublime, the great and the enduring in man fell away and became a monkey's trick!"". Harry on Hermine: ""The scene that had gone before became more and more unreal. I was less and less able to believe that these were the same eyes that a moment before had been fixed in a dread obsession. But in this Hermine was like life itself, one moment succeeding to the next and not one to be foreseen. Now she was eating, and the duck and the salad, the cake and the liquor were the important things, and each time the plates were changed a new chapter began. Yet thought she played at being a child she had seen through me completely, and though she made me her pupil there and then in the game of living for each fleeting moment, she seems to know more of life than is known to the wisest of the wise. It might be the highest wisdom of the merest artlessness. it is certain in any case that life is quite disarmed by the gift to live so entirely in the present, to treasure with such eager care every flower by the wayside and the light that plays on every passing moment. Was I to believe that this happy child with her hearty appetite and the air of a gourmet was at the same time a victim of hysterical visions who wished to die? Or a careful calculating woman who, unmoved herself, had the conscious intention of making me her lover and her slave? I could not believe it. No, her surrender to the moment was so simple and complete that the fleeting shadows and agitation to the very depths of the soul come to her no less than every pleasurable impulse and were lived as fully."""

I've grown to appreciate it more, especially in re-reading in August 2011. But my initial reaction will stay here, anyway:. An enjoyable foray through the dark days of Stalinist Russia, but one that may be somewhat undercut by its increasing reliance on the magical to move the plot. Political references abound, but usually not in any manner central to the story, and I found myself wondering at times what Bulgakov's purpose had been. Fortunately, a secondary story giving a strangely areligious and grounded account of Pontius Pilate's involvement in Jesus' last days eventually takes an almost central role, and lends the novel its greatest thematic resonance. What perplexes me is not that the book is successful -- it is indeed an interesting and entertaining piece of fiction -- but that it has attained such strong adoration lately. Multiple people have cited this to me as a favorite book recently, and it seems to come up frequently in conversation. What makes this such a defining work of its era, I wonder?"

Consider the employing of Satan as a central character, then a smart talking cat as his accomplice, then a host of unusual occurrences, then a writer, his lover, a poet... Such thought though specific to the Soviet at a specific time definitely expands beyond that region.. It can be understood why publication took so long..."

Curious novels with at last three stories. I will retain especially the role of the Devil. The devil discusses existence of God, whereas if God do not exist, evil either. The book was written in full Stalinism.. The book is thus in the romantic line of Faust, but it is also a metaphor of Stalinism. It is there the genius of Boulgakov and the singularity of the book. If rather poor metaphysics is not shared, We are retained humour and the demonstation."

11/04/2021,b13,r4223,9994003,Paulina,"Jan 28, 2021",5,"Even though a considerable amount of the allegory probably went over my head, I enjoyed this as the masterpiece it's hailed as. Love, horror, wit, fantasy, good/evil. The catholic in me had some mental hoops to jump through in reconciling the way the relationship, between good and evil and therefore God and the Devil are portrayed, particularly the ambiguity; how they intertwine at times and work together (?) to influence human lives.. Basically after I reconciled that. in just this one instance. I didn't have to HATE the devil...I fell in love with the adventure Bulgakov was taking me on.. Side note: The Devil describes ""cowardice"" as the ""worst sin of all"". Coincidentally I am reading The Divine Comedy, albeit slowly, at the same time where the ""worst sin"" is described as 'traitors to kin, homeland, guests, and worst of all - Benefactors' - aka Judas.. It is in its own right a love story - the Master and Margarita. Who through an agreement btwn God and the Devil end up together. But even before this, Margarita, impaired heavily by her loss of the Master and considering suicide, ends up making a pact with the Devil in order for them to meet again. And it is the devil, the epitome of all that is evil and vile, who ends up saying - ""he who loves must share the lot of the one he loves"".. But, ""I couldn't help but wonder""... that considering the general nature of a favor or gift from the devil, and how these situations ultimately unfold- with trickery, sadness, loss, fine print one is never aware of, exchanges one did not agree to - was the removing of Margarita and the Master from Moscow, albeit together, and placing them in a cottage in the woods, over a mossy stone bridge, in an environment of 'stillness and peace' - another act of deception by the Great Deceiver? Could removing them from the world they knew, their material possessions, society and placing them in solitude (solitary confinement?) be considered a form of exile? and ultimately, punishment? I'd like to think not. And this exchange between Jesus' disciple and the devil gives me hope:. - ""What did he bid you tell me, slave?"". - ""I am not a slave, I am his disciple."". - ""We speak different languages, as usual, but this does not change the things we speak about. Well?..."". - ""He read the Master's work, and He asks you to take the Master with you and reward him with peace. Is that so difficult for you, spirit of evil?"". - ""Nothing is difficult for me, and you know it very well."" He was silent for a while, and added: ""And why don't you take him with you, into the light?"". - ""He has not earned light, he earned peace."" Levi answered sadly.. - ""Tell him it will be done. And leave my at once."". - ""He asks you also to take along the one who loved him and suffered because of him."". Things that stuck out to me:. ""He suddenly wiped an unexpected tear with his right sleeve and continued: ‘Love leaped out in front of us like a murderer in an alley leaping out of nowhere, and struck us both at once. As lightning strikes, as a Finnish knife strikes! She, by the way, insisted afterwards that it wasn’t so, that we had, of course, loved each other for a long, long time, without knowing each other, never having seen each other.."". ""The master leaped out of the saddle, left the group and ran to the sheer edge of the hill. The black cloak trailed on the ground after him. The Master turned his eyes to the city. At first his heart contracted with an aching sadness, but soon this gave way to sweet disquiet, a Gypsy's wandering unrest."". ""Gods, gods! How sad the evening earth! How mysterious the mists over the bogs! Whoever has wandered in these mists, whoever suffered deeply before death, whoever flew over this earth burdened beyond human strength knows it. The weary one knows it. And he leaves without regret the mists of the earth, its swamps and rivers, and yields himself with an easy heart to the hands of death, knowing that it alone can bring surcease."". ""But would you kindly ponder this question: What would your good do if evil didn't exist, and what would the earth look like if all the shadows disappeared? After all, shadows are cast by things and people. Here is the shadow of my sword. But shadows also come from trees and living beings. Do you want to strip the earth of all trees and living things just because of your fantasy of enjoying naked light?"". “'Punch a man on the nose, kick an old man downstairs, shoot somebody or any old thing like that, that’s my job.. But argue with women in love—no thank you!. '” ...lol. I have been trying to find a suitable picture of Behemoth (an enormous black cat in the company of the devil who walks on his hind legs, drinks vodka and has a penchant for sarcasm) to leave you with, but all the versions make him seem too evil and unsophisticated enough for my taste.. Closest I could find:"
11/04/2021,b13,r4224,1188122,Kara Babcock,"Oct 10, 2009",4,"Honestly, I'm a little intimidated.. I didn't realize that. The Master and Margarita. is an ""unfinished"" masterpiece, complete in its narrative but still unpolished prior to Bulgakov's death. As with any published unfinished work, there's a certain amount of third-party editing that will alter the interpretation of the text. To compound this problem, I'm an Anglophone reading a translation from Russia. I'm not as familiar with Russian literature or Russian history as I could be. As a result, a great deal is lost in translation across the barriers of both language and culture.. This book is rife with allusions literary, cultural, and musical. Bulgakov constantly makes plays on words that refer to Russian writers and poets with whom I'm not familiar, as well as incorporating aspects of poems and works, like. Faust. , that I haven't read. By reading the notes at the end of this edition, I get the idea that there's a great deal of irony at the expense of the Soviet regime in 1930s Russia—again, it was difficult for me to appreciate that on my own. I feel like this is a book full of subtext I can't comprehend at this point in my life. That's nothing to be ashamed about. I'm young, and I'm sure that as I grow older, I will re-read books and discover new elements to them that went undetected before. Still, it's frustrating, especially in something as sublime as. The Master and Margarita. .. Of course, those eponymous characters don't actually show up until later in the book. First we get to see the effects of the devil's visit to Moscow. Indirectly or directly referred to as ""the devil"" and ""Satan,"" Woland isn't necessarily ""evil"" in the absolute moral sense of the word. He's a trickster and a tempter, but from the perspective of some people, like Margarita, he's an omnipotent saviour. He represents darkness, yes, but a darkness that must exist so that we may also have light—an embodiment of a dualistic philosophy at odds with the overt Christian nature of the mythology in this book. This is not merely a story about a sympathetic devil character; it's a decontextualization of the devil as part of the Christian mythos. Bulgakov does this partly to evince religious themes, but I suspect it's more to satirize Soviet society.. Investigators conclude that the inexplicable events in Moscow during Woland's stay were the result of a group of highly-skilled foreign hypnotists. The sheer absurdity of the previous sentence should drive home the gleeful way in which Bulgakov prods at the strange bureaucratic creature that was his government. Everything must be explained, rationally and according to the proper procedure, even if the explanations eventually offered are nonsensical and absurd. Everything has its place in the grand scheme.. As the epilogue puts it, referring to the characters in the narrative, ""Absolutely nothing happened to them, nor could it have since they never existed in reality."" There's a twin meaning to this sentence. Nothing happened, because some of the events depicted in this story border too close to criticism of Bulgakov's government, something that would have met the heavy hand of the censors. This is an utter and complete work of fiction, a dream of a character who himself is fictitious. At the same time, it emphasizes the categorical denial by the government that anything supernatural could be responsible for the disruptions in Moscow: the official Party line is that God doesn't exist, so neither does the devil.. The devil isn't the only one treated sympathetically here. Pontius Pilate is portrayed in a sympathetic light through chapters from the Master's destroyed manuscript. Here, he's just this guy, you know? Doing his job. Managing people, networking, joining Facebook groups—er, I mean, interrogating prisoners. We get the sense that he actually believes Jesus is a harmless guy, a genuinely nice guy, but Pilate has to execute him anyway, because he spoke out against Caesar (notice the parallels to 1930s Russia). I loved this version of Pilate, finding in him a kernel of nihilism that would ordinarily seem out of place in a book about Christianity. Pilate. is. a tragic character, neither saviour nor saved. He is offered no potential for redemption, forgiven only by the grace of Margarita after nearly 2000 years of limbo. And, as with most of the ill-fated characters in this book, Pilate didn't stand a chance. Fate was gunning for him, just as Fate was gunning for Berlioz, for Bezdomny, for the Master himself until Margarita, again, stepped into the fray. So what about the Master and Margarita? When they finally grace us with their presence, were they worth the wait?. The Master is a fairly undeveloped character. We don't learn his real name. All we know is that he's an artist who managed to earn the undying devotion of the beautiful, capable Margarita. And he wrote a novel about Pontius Pilate that eventually resulted in him being committed to a psychiatric institution. In terms of plot, he exists mostly so Margarita can save him. And I suppose he provides some interesting information to Bezdomny. Thematically, the Master represents the persecuted writer. There's a sense of the despair that, even if an author is. permitted. to write certain works and promised little censorship of them, he or she still exists in an intolerant, suspicious society, and thus his or her work will always suffer and be constrained. The Master is constantly struggling not just for freedom but for an understanding of what form that freedom will take. He frees himself of any name, save the honorific given to him by Margarita. He frees himself from society by entering a psychiatric clinic. He is freed from life and from Moscow when Azazello ""kills"" him. Perhaps most notably, he frees himself from the one thing in his life that has consumed everything else, the novel about Pontius Pilate. He burns the manuscript, only to discover that ""manuscripts don't burn,"" and have it restored to him by Woland—a very romantic condemnation of censorship if ever there was one. The Master reinvents himself almost as often as Woland and his demonic associates do.. Margarita reinvents herself one major time, becoming a witch to save her lover. But we get glimpses of previous transformations as we learn how unhappy she was with her life as wife to a well-off man. The Master changed that for her, and with him gone, she has little for which to live except the hope that he may one day reappear. The fact that Margarita seizes upon any chance to help the Master, even if it means making a pact with the devil, instantly makes her one of the most human characters in this narrative. Margarita is neither innocent nor pure; however, she consistently acts on behalf of others rather than herself. When granted a boon by Woland, she first asks for another rogue to be spared her eternal Sisyphean torment. She then asks for the Master to be returned to her—selfish on the surface, but remember that she believes he will genuinely be happier with her than elsewhere, and such is the case.. Their happy ending is not the only happy ending, if the narrator is truthful. Woland's merry little group—and more the members of the group than Woland himself—cause a good deal of disruption in Moscow, burning buildings and scattering fake notes and, heaven forfend, foreign currency! They ruin some lives, but the actual body count is quite low. And the epilogue insists that the majority of the characters whose lives are deranged in this story end up the better for it, finding niches in which they are happier. Again, is this really the work of the devil? Woland is, more than a straight avatar of the devil, the embodiment of chaos more often just disruptive than harmful.. The Master and Margarita. is dense but not dull. It's not light reading, in that there's enough subtext to keep you thinking about it long after you're finished the book. At the same time, there's genuine wit and irony in here, of the kind that demonstrates humour isn't. just. for comedy. This is a book very much a product of its time and of that time's politics that is very much relevant in any time with any politics."
11/04/2021,b13,r4225,11532584,Jacqueline,"Jan 27, 2021",3,"What a challenging, chaotic book. And yet, within the total chaos of characters, there is room for humor. I ended up enjoying it more than I thought.. The Master and Margarita is my first Russian classic and I have to say, starting it was daunting. It was very different from what I had expected though - much more humorous! In this work, the devil visits Moscow with his gang of cronies. Rather than being all out evil, the gang is something else - painfully honest. Sure, violence is part of how this is expressed, but it is almost justified by the way they work. Besides this, the demonic characters have personalities that go beyond villainous or self-righteous.. The significance of the title of the book only becomes apparant later on in the book - before even meeting the master or Margarita a ton of other characters are introduced. This was one of the reasons that I thought the book was hard to get into - all of these names and not seeing who is relevant and who isn't.. On face value, the book is entertaining and I started enjoying it from about 70 pages in. It also leaves a lot of open questions - to answer some of these, I'll be doing some extra reading ;)"
11/04/2021,b13,r4226,4554994,Tanuj Solanki,"Sep 19, 2011",3,"Manuscripts don't burn. Bulgakov's 'The Master and Margarita' begins at a breath-taking pace, befuddling the reader with what may just be one of the strangest openings to a novel. The first three chapters have an undeniable hypnotic quality of their own, including the second chapter where the narrative breaks into initiating a parallel story. The action moves fast till the end of the third chapter, when suddenly, the reader has to deal with a severed head lolling about on a Moscow street. A pivotal point in the novel, really! It is through the bizarreness of this severed head, built up with the conversations that led up to it, that the darkly-comic nature of the novel reveals itself and the reader is pushed into suspending his disbelief for the rest of the ride, understanding the super-natural as a part and parcel of the work.. From the fourth chapter though, the first intimations of what plagues the entire book start surfacing: a too-slow-too-fast problem, where some scenes - especially the absurd ones - trundle along lethargically, while others - including key character development areas - are furnished rather sloppily. The reader starts questioning: ""Am I to read this as a thriller? Turn the pages quickly to find out what happens next?"" And it is this questioning, this doubt, that takes the fizz out of the book on many occasions in Part I. There are too many scenes where Bulgakov's sole intent seems to be to recreate the delight of the first chapters. Too many times where Bulgakov seems to be asking the reader to revel in the absurdity of what is presented before him. The problem is both of excess and of contradiction: Once amazed with the promise of the story, the reader is repeatedly made aware of his current state of suspended disbelief, which in turn reduces reader delight considerably. The reader, tired of these levitations that gas-out every now and then, starts looking for other areas in the novel - well-formed characters, meaningful narratives etc. - and is severely disappointed, at least in Part I, where the stress on the shockingly dramatic overpowers some key formalities of the form of a modern novel. The danger here is corporal - that the reader construe the novel as essentially interested in caricature and stop reading. Bulgakov clearly underestimated this danger. Or perhaps he didn't have much time to edit the manuscript.. Then comes the beginning of Part II, where Bulgakov's inspiration comes back the strongest. Once again he starts the levitation, this time propelling the reader on a ride that is as absurd as it beautiful. But this time the levitation is literal. Bulgakov's heroine, Margarita, becomes a witch and rides naked on a broom over 1930s Moscow. In fact, these were my favorite chapters - Margarita the witch performing her aeronautical histrionics. In my calcualtion these are seminal pieces, reperesentative of the highest form of literary art. Their representation of sudden cathartic liberation (Margarita, invisible in her flight, shatters the windows of DRAMLIT - a putative society of writers and dramatists of the Communist regime), is nothing less than extraordinary, considering, of course, the political climate in which the book was written {STALIN's purge}.. But then Margarita's flight ends, and in the lull that follows the exhilarated reader starts to guess the ensuing events with increasing clarity. Suspense at the reader's side begins to mitigate faster than the drab unfolding of events in the novel. Thus, once again, Bulgakov's lack of control on the pace of the narrative exposes itself. What happens? Well, we are subjected to a lengthy party, where absurdity clasps us and meanings flicker only faintly and intermittently. Too many topical allusions, too much for the current reader to ignore and move on. Once again the reader queries - ""Can I skip the pages now? I can sense what will happen. I'm interested in how it happens and if there is a meaning to all this at all"". And how does Bulgakov explain everything? What is his message? Not much. That there is good and evil in the world and that good doesn't always result in good and evil may sometimes do better. What was the exact intent of this message considering 1930s Moscow, I'm yet to decipher. But I strongly believe that what Bulgakov created can in fact be understood through a single abstraction: that in a world of political absurdity, the society requires myths to sustain himself. To me, ""The Master and Margarita"" is an attempt to create a parable as strong as a viable myth. Bulgakov's myths are religious, nay Biblical, and we can blame his religious dispositiong for that. Many critics have called the work blatantly religious but I don't think that is true. There is enough literary punch here. Conversely, there is a myth here that is propounded more subtly but stays in fidelity with the discerning reader - the myth of literature's importance in a society. Through his Satan Bulgakov expostulates - ""Manuscripts don't burn"" and the reader doesn't fail to realize that this indeed is the summation of the entire book!"
11/04/2021,b13,r4227,1245181,Tom,"Aug 20, 2011",4,"Hmm, Satan as agent of salvation in a corrupt state? That seems to be one question B. addresses in this novel. The salvation in this case, though, is more aesthetic and political than theological -- I think. The grand theme is one of faith and belief in various forms: the Master has lost faith in his novel about Pontius Pilate; Russian citizens don't believe in Satan or black magic, and Woland punishes them for their insistence on empirical truth. Not having read my Milton (oh, the shame!), I can't say how or if B. is working with or against literary tradition of Satan. For all his nonchalant violence and chaos, Wolands seem easily swayed by Margarita's pleas on behalf of a man writing a novel about the ultimate corruption of faith. Are we to believe that Margarita has sold her soul by agreeing to be queen of Satan's Ball? The novel raises all sorts of interesting questions re faith, but if it offers a coherent vision of faith, I haven't worked it out yet. (any thoughts out there?). On to more practical matters: this was my 2nd reading, 10 years after the first, and the virtues and flaws were more pronounced this time. Though still highly entertaining, this time I found the political and literary satire of scenes set in Moscow a wee bit tiresome, or overly long, anyway. Part of the problem is that they are mostly written as straight descpritive action, never or rarely entering minds of charcters in any way that makes them fully 3-dimensional characters. So for larger chunck, the novel skates along the surface, granted with lots of fancy and hilarious moves, but some scenes tend to run on like extended clown skits at the circus, and since these scenes, all set in the present Moscow of novel, make up the bulk of novel, it can get rather wearisome. Oddly, this was the suff I loved the most my first reading. This time around, it was the chapters on Pilate that I found most riveting and moving, and that's because B. develops PP as a 3-dimensional charcter, part arrogant, political bureaucrat concerned only with preserving his own powers and part insecure victim plagued by demands of political machinations of expediencies and by his own doubts about his cowardice in the face of public opinion and his desire to do the fair and just thing. B's language and tone change markedly here, demonstrating his impressive range. These sections, only 3 chapters unfortunately, make this one of the great political novels of all time, but as for the rest, I got tired of wading through it to get back to PP.. Overall, is this a great novel? Does Bulgakov belong in the ranks of Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Chekhov? Not in my opinion. He occupies a slot beneath those folks. Mind you, that's still plenty impressive, and I don't mean to disparage the novel. Anyone reading it for first time, I think would find the satire greatly entertaining, and some scenes still made me hoot aloud. My reactions this time around just confirm my growing belief that it's not the writing that changes but one's evolving taste as a reader. With a third reading in another 10 years, I'm sure I'll have yet another reaction. But that's part of the fun of returning to favorite books over time.. A note re translations: I read Mirra Ginsburg edition first time, the P/V edition this time, and I think I preferred Ginsburg. P/V often use wordy prepositional noun phrases where G. uses a more direct, streamlined wording: For example, P/V open the novel with ""At the hour of the hot, spring sunset ... "" whereas G. and others write ""On a warm spring evening ... "" or something along those lines, don't have text in front of me. A minor annoyance, but done repeatedly over the course of a long novel, such stylistic speed bumps can make for a bumpy ride. Having taught freshmen comp for 20 years, I'm probably too sensitive to such distractions. Whether this style more faithfully captures B's Russian, I can't say. Just something that jumped out at me."
11/04/2021,b13,r4228,77379896,Drew,"Jan 09, 2021",5,"If asked what my favorite books are, from now on I will always include Bulgakov’s ‘The Master and Margarita.’ Beyond its fascinating publishing history and excellent writing, Bulgakov gives us an intelligent, earnest, and hilarious novel. This is a very rare combination, and I couldn’t believe how good the novel continued to get as I made my way to the end. It is a novel critiquing Soviet Russia. It gives an interesting retelling of the story of Christ’s execution & the guilt of Pontius Pilate who condemned him. It explores what would happen if Satan arrives in your city to hold a magic show; illuminates how cowardice is indeed the worst vice; shows that there is a deep connection between humor and freedom; and it reminds us that, sometimes, we are only granted peace but not light, and that this can be enough.. My favorite character is Behemoth, the hilarious, pig-sized black cat with an attitude and a handgun."

He began to listen to what was happening in his heart. His excitement, it seemed to him, had given way to a profound and grievous sense of hurt. But it was only momentary and gave place to one of proud indifference and finally to a presentiment of eternal peace.”"

I get the connection, absurd, disconnected in many ways from the normal novel structure, but boy oh boy. I did not understand what this was all about at all. When they first introduce Pilate, I was excited and surprised, and the chapter on Matthew staking out the cross is superb, as is the ball scene. But what ever is going on elsewhere? I was at times drawn to the idea that this was in mockery of communism, then it seemed that it was being paralleled to devilry, then I assumed it was being debunked by the devil. I got lost in the many twists and unfollowed paths of his ideas. It was in the end a labour of love, a challenge because it made me think about what it MEANT. I didn't like any of the characters, and I couldn't understand the point of the story. And it was such a shame because I thought Fatal Eggs was brilliant and funny and entertaining."
11/04/2021,b13,r4231,49039481,Alastair,"Oct 13, 2017",3,"I found this book surreal, absurdist and confusing. I can see the novels influence on The Rolling Stones, Pearl Jam and maybe even JK Rowling in the scenes set at Woland’s ball; a massive hall within the confines of a Moscow flat with brandy fountains, monkey bands and reanimated corpses; not to mention the giant taking cat, naked witches and people turned into flying pigs. I know the novel is not about the devil or , Jesus or Pilate but about Stalinist Russia and a thinly veiled attack on the Moscow arts establishment. It was just a little bit weird for me maybe it was those things I’ve already mentioned or it could be that I found it hard to suspend my disbelief to the degree required over 445 pages of longer chapters of close text. I was pleased I finished it and will maybe look out some of Bulgakov’s other novels."

I think that this may be the reason that the plot is so repetitive and slow in the first book.. I am not really sure if I liked it.

The rendition is very funny, though sometimes it degenerates into goofy - those were not my favourite parts. I loved the cat with its flair and inflated sense of importance.. Pontius Pilate seems to stand as a symbol of Russia, which decided to abandon Christ (and thus God), but was then tormented by the inability of having more philosophical engagement with the nature of being."

For instance, two days ago, I would think about the Soviet Union and how life might have been then, but now I consider that the essence of this book is its mysticism more than anything else. Maybe tomorrow I will be intrigued by another aspect concerning this novel, but one thing is sure - all the myths and supernatural circumstances have made me overthink, even though the book's ending is quite comforting, I still have the feeling I need to figure out the mystery."

Having said that I take my hat off to the Muirs for bringing Kafka into English in the first place, their exploration through translation paralleling their sojourn in Europe in the inter-war period described in Muir's.

The plot point was actually non-existent cause the case was very vague and unknown. Josef K. really had no idea why he was arrested and in need for the criminal proceedings so it was like his story somehow leading to a never ending narrative. I love the tension Franz puts in his plot in between K's ramblings and thoughts though somehow it was a bit overreacting and dramatic, but I personally like on how it goes and find it very unique. Just like the manufacturer's case, the story of K giving me an anxiety. It was draggy to the point that it gripped my understanding, totally intriguing but so hopeless I have no idea where it will lead me to but somehow I adore the absurdity of the political and sociological issues it portrayed. I felt pity for K to be stucked inside an inefficient bureaucracy and problematic legal system.. Mysteriously creative, it gave me a view on how a person can just accept a relentless guilt and troubled himself to the point that it doesn't make sense at all. A bit of scandals and affairs though this part quite unnecessary in my opinion. A morbid reality of a system, confusing and perpetual but weirdly fascinating."

11/04/2021,b15,r4875,42348000,Graham Stull,"Apr 02, 2018",5,"When you get used to reading inferior books, even a nibble of a great masterpiece can challenge your digestive system in ways that cause stomach cramps. Franz Kafka is no light read. After a diet of heavily processed modern literature, Franz Kafka's The Trial is as hard to digest as a meal of wholegrain rice and raw vegetables would be to a junk food aficionado. And yet like its gastronomical equivalent, Kafka's prose stays with you and nourishes you much longer.. Though hard to digest, The Trial is not hard to chew. The prose is in fact deceptively accessible, inviting the reader into a world that is familiar enough, and well rendered enough, to suspend one's disbelief, despite the many incongruities that make that world so intriguing and so mysterious. This, indeed, is the fine art of surrealism: To lure the reader with hyper-realistically crafted descriptions into the acceptance of things he might otherwise dismiss as simply absurd.. But unlike, say, a Magritte painting, Kafka's Trial does not stop at flaunting absurdity. Instead, it takes the reader well beyond the ridiculous into something far more dangerous, as we accompany Joseph K., our middle-aged protagonist, on his descent into insanity. We begin our journey in his bedroom, following him into the bank at which he holds a mid-ranking position, into a farcical courtroom and through the various sordid relationships that belie his repressed sexuality. At no point are we sure of what is truly real and what is a projection of his mental illness. Yet the quality of the prose is such that we can glimpse through the cracks in the protagonist's madness the light of a more solid world; one that is just beyond his grasp, the existence of which is indispensable for us to appreciate what Joseph K. is experiencing.. The narrative device which Kafka uses to set up this surreality is the bureaucracy of a modern judicial system. This is particularly effective for any reader who has had the displeasure of knowing the vagaries of an inefficient and often self-contradictory public administration; in particular, the infuriating functioning of the legal system. Bureaucracies really are insane, which makes it all the easier for us to accept what Joseph K. is going through. Yet we are reminded at regular intervals that this device is only a metaphor, and that the trial, the court which hosts it and the many court attendants we meet throughout the story, are all of the protagonist's own making.. It's possible, if one reads about Kafka's life, to draw parallels and seek explanations for this or that aspect of the book. But I feel doing so adds nothing to the reader's experience. My best advice is to sit down at the table, clear your palate and take small and deliberate bites.. But be prepared to spend a lot of time digesting."

An experience that I assure you, is worth having..

The thing I love about it is he lays the whole legal system out like a bored butcher laying a piece of meat on a slab for you to examine - no frills, no emotions or diatribe, just how it is.. But it’s a certain kind of legal system. It’s the kind when a republic turns into an evil empire as all nations cyclically do per Plato, like Russia did then, and America is now. It’s that point where it’s laws descend into the jungle of the law of accident like the endless rabit holes in the forest of Alice and Wonderland and there is no certain up or down, in or out, rhyme or reason, fate or justice, just a conundrum.. You don’t know what you are being tried for or by whom (nor do many of the public servants serving in it); you don’t know how long it will last, what the verdict might be, if it is to ever end and, if it will, when? All you know is now your life is put into permanent suspended animation indefinitely; but not like cryogenics though, more like a gnat you can’t remove from your skin, and now you will live like that from here on out.. I could have only read it drunk laughing at the truth of it or it would have probably attracted all that into my life. I’m only a 40% believer in Law of Attraction and “your being attracts your life” or I would have no sympathy for the innocently downtrodden - which is ridiculous - but 40% is a lot. There are also some though who don’t attract this behemoth, it just descends upon them unjustly in society like a cloud of locusts; it just happens upon them.. The only way out? Maybe a certain chapter in the Dawn Treader combined with what Gandhi did - if the way of power is a way. Or the “Tower of Siloam” parable if the way of smoke and of strange wanderers is to be the way. There is also a middle way. Yojimbo is the best movie ever made about that.. Unravel it, our yourself from it, or speed up both sides dismantling each other mechanically - either way, make sure it is before the figures figure out; because they are not conscious, least of all self-conscious - and even less in possession of tactful wonderful every day buried deep conscience.. The ancients knew of a state called walking around hypnotic pre-conscious preening...maybe that is what most are in most the time and Kafka is showing this in his inebriatingly lucid & awake portrayal. It was a state (the former) called Mekhenes in Aramaic and is what is in the Bible when Jesus said blessed are the Mehkeness for they shall inherit...(wait for it..not the Kingdom of Heaven): the earth. He was said to have a great sense of irony as one must in the iron age to survive psychologically."

It's tempting to suggest that Kafka foresaw the state-horrors of nazism and communist socialism, but this 1924 novel was firmly grounded in Kafka's view of the world as it was (and, in my view, still remains).

11/04/2021,b15,r4887,1024945,Adam Floridia,"Sep 27, 2009",4,"There is so much I want write about this book that I am afraid I won’t be able to express all my thoughts in any coherent manner. Well, here goes…. This is a brilliant novel. The fact that Kafka didn’t even finish it makes that statement even more impressive. It astounds and baffles me that Kafka wished for this and all his other works to be incinerated after his death—he did not wish to leave ANY literary legacy. Since it reveals such an intimate and scintillating look into Kafka’s writing process and his sense of self, the material (unfinished chapters, deletions, diary entries) in the appendices of this edition is remarkable in itself.. The novel proper begins with the seemingly absurd arrest of Joseph K. who is thrust into the equally absurd machinations of an absurd Court system. Because I knew that this fits into the Absurdist movement and because of the title, I assumed the book would mainly dwell on the outlandish procedures of an illogical legal system and even contain some grotesquely surreal courtroom scenes. I was wrong.. Like “The Metamorphoses,” which begins with an equally absurdly-marvelous first line, The Trial immediately pits its protagonist into a remarkable situation and then primarily focuses with how the individual copes with it. This indirect form of characterization works profoundly well in this case; as aspects of K.’s character are slowly revealed I began to actually question his innocence and to see him as an Everyman.. Even though the first line asserts that K. is arrested “without having done anything wrong,” his behavior throughout the book suggests a certain guilt beyond the realm of worldly courts. His haughty attitude and supercilious nature become more and more apparent with each passing page. Assertions like “consider that I don’t care at all what the outcome of the case is, and that I would laugh at it if I were sentenced” (53) demonstrate his complete nonchalance and even arrogance in the face of dangers that, although unnamed, are very serious and very real. Guilty or not from the outset, he never thinks of the consequences of his later actions, always presuming that his superior attitude will be enough to validate him. At one point, even his uncle berates him saying, “‘Your indifference drives me mad!’” (97). This is where I really began to see K. guilty of a crime perhaps far worse than a banal misdemeanor or even violent felony; K. seems to be guilty of existential ennui.. Eventually trying to take charge of his own case, K. plans to “recall the whole of [his:] life to mind” (128). What better way to discern whether one’s life, one’s very existence has been meaningful in any way? If one decides that it has not, then isn’t he guilty after all? Only once he is aware of the working of the Law (the Divine Law???) does he actually become reflective, but at this point it might be too late. For example, he has trouble coping with the fact that daily life does not stop simply because he is having an existential crisis, for this is something he should have been wrestling with daily. Life cannot stop simply because he is finally becoming introspective; after all, “we all have our troubles” (135) and must come to terms with our own reason for being because “everything belongs to the court” (151).. Other random thoughts that I could not smoothly work into my review:. -Is the entire novel an internal struggle between id, ego, and superego? The “The Whipper” section and subconscious guilt expressed therein first made me think “id, id!”. -The parable relayed in “The Cathedral” section is one of the best short pieces ever. It definitely beats the much more famous “The Grand Inquisitor” section The Brothers Karamazov!. -Did I miss a lot of religious symbolism (especially in “The Cathedral” section)? (K. and his two warders at the end suggest any type of trinity???). -I will end with my most jejune observation by saying that what I took away from the book can be summed up with a quotation from Braveheart: “Every man dies. Not everyman really lives.” We all die—“As a rule all cases are foregone conclusions” (Kafka 62)—it is up to us to determine how and even if we really live."
11/04/2021,b15,r4888,4472316,Zulfiya,"Jun 21, 2012",4,"Each man's death diminishes me,. For I am involved in mankind.. Therefore, send not to know. For whom the bell tolls,. It tolls for thee.. These wonderful words by John Donne epitomize humanism and social collective responsibility, and they also illustrate what this novel is NOT about. The book is a perfect illustration of Kafkaesque vision – it is about alienation, hidden and haunting menace, anxiety, unknown and unknowable complexity of the world around. Where does this alienation stem around? Kafka was born in the Jewish family and was exploring Jewish culture and spiritual heritage most of his life. At the same time the place of his birth is Prague, Bohemia, and all his books and short stories were written in German. So he was a cross-cultural person, a person open to other ethnic and linguistic cultures, a person with the cosmopolitan background. Could this really be the origin of his desire to show the world as a menacing inner cosmos of a man, trapped in his own perception?. Or should we also account for Kafka’s mental and physical condition? It is widely known that Kafka died from starvation caused by tuberculosis. His Jewish background could be viewed as an eye-opening experience only by modern standards. At the time of his life and death Jews were persecuted and often displaced and eventually lived in ghettos. Kafka’s mental state (personality disorder) and the general plight of the Jews obviously changed his vision of individuality and in the long run affected his creative perception of reality. Whether these facts really influenced Kafka’s writing is still a point of debate in the literary world, but one thing is definite – The Trial is a work of monumental significance and innovation. The main character, Josef K., a chief financial officer in the big bank, finds one morning that he is arrested and charged with an unspecified crime. The nature of this crime will never be disclosed either to K. (that is how he is called in the novel) or to readers. K is later summoned to attend a court session on SUNDAY?!! (a salvation day) and, what is more, the people around him know about his legal predicament. The only person who does not know what is going on is K. This element of plot (if this is the appropriate term for the literary impressionism) definitely creates this emanation of secrecy, anxiety, suspicion, and alienation – K. is painfully unaware how the system functions, how and what people he should approach, and what his next steps are. These feelings of anxiety and suspicion portray “the emotional landscape” of hypochondria and rejection.. During the following months K. learns about numerous cases the court is dealing with – so he is not the only one, and this might explain why the abbreviated version of his last name is used – he is one of many. Besides, it heightens the stenographic style of his writing, and it also conveys a certain message of predetermination. Another explanation of this bizarre novel is a symbolic one – K’s unknown crime is an allusion to an Original Sin (the episode in the cathedral when K is told a fable about the origin and the purpose of the gates).. K’s final moments are permeated with the feeling of his personal calamity and demise. K. accepts his brutal death with no resistance and his final words ‘Like a dog!’ state that life is non-consequential, inexplicable, confused, and often brutal.. The sad, disjointed impressionistic novel is a brilliantly penetrating insight not only into the world of law, red tape, and bureaucracy, but it is also a powerful voice, portraying human alienation and anxiety due to the unknown nature of human existence. The novel masterfully warns us about the oppressive regime when a person can become a nobody in a blink of an eye and consequently be lost in the well of the on-going cases, court sessions, appellations, provisional verdicts of innocence, and re-initiation of legal processes. A real human being in flesh and blood is lost in this nightmare of legal practice and is haunted by the eternal and intimidating unknown. The bleak reality of the literary masterpiece."

From constantly introducing new, bizarre characters, to tactful building of suspense, to powerful imagery and witty, dark humour even; one can never get bored!. Definitely envelops you in a world stuffed with terror at every corner. Everyone becomes the boogyman in a way. One can say it reflects the anxieties that he had to constantly endure, but that would reduce the story to a mere cry for help. I think there's a critical take on the institutions we navigate through, how within a liberal world, they tend to become cob-webbed machines that sort of eat themselves up and flatten out those within it.. In a way, this book tries to get to the reader to experience this ""flattening out"" with the progression of the narrative: as Joseph's frustration with surprises slowly subsides, one develops a sense of flattened emotions, where a sort of submissive indifference and apathy take over, eventhough the only option available to remind one of their individuality is to hope that things work out.. Long story short, it's a good read! Highly recommend!"

A long time back, I started this book by a writer who was said to be the Salvador Dalí of the literary world (or maybe Dalí is the Kafka of the art world, but I digress). Kafka wrote some bizarre literature. So much so, that it earned him his own adjective - Kafkaesque; a nightmarish situation which most people can somehow relate to, although strongly surreal. With an ethereal, ""evil"", omnipotent power floating just beyond the senses.. The trial is truly Kafkaesque in that sense. The premise is so absurd that it becomes very interesting. It's the story of a man, Josef K. (loved how the translator used 'f' instead of the 'ph' sound that is usually used for that name. Makes it so much more European) who is facing a trial, but doesn't know what the charges are. The story follows him through this harrowing situation where he is met with inexplicable situations and confounding events that leave you with a foreboding sense of despair.. The courts are weird and the servants of the court are weirder still. But, the lawyer who defends Josef and the painter whom he meets to seek his help are just insane! There are also 4 female characters in the story who have a very strange relationship with K. Mrs. Grubach his landlady, loves him to bits and admires him despite the trial looming over his head. Miss Bürstner, initially likes him but becomes hostile for some unexplained reason and avoids him completely. There's a woman from the court who is a court servant's wife, who looks upon K. as her deliverer and beseeches him for help. And finally, there's Leni, the maid at the Lawyer's house who finds him incredibly attractive and irresistible.. There's a lot that Kafka is trying to say through these characters. And it is interesting to note how different people react to the news of him being charged for a criminal offence.. What stands out though, is the mind-numbing bureaucratic maze that K. has to navigate. This, I think is Kafka's forte, to bring out the absolute despair and hopelessness of the legal system in a surreal and disconcerting way, with brilliant undertones of satire and an overwhelming sense of inescapable doom.. Throughout the story, K. is convinced that he is innocent, but not at one point is he unaffected by this mysterious allegation that has come to claim him. There's no question about his innocence, but he shows all the tell-tale signs of a guilty person, especially because he tries not to show them.. Towards the end, Kafka discusses one of my favorite parables (written once again, by himself),. ""Before the law"". , and presents amazing contrasting opinions on the same story that lend a lot of perspective to the novel and establishes the story in better light. It is the last few pages of the book that actually made me like it. So, I would suggest that you shouldn't give it up mid-way.. This is a book that will take a bit of effort to keep up with, but once you get used to the style, it is a brilliant read with some stunningly real descriptions of mundane events in such a surreal context. See for yourself in this. collection of excerpts from 'The Trial'.. Rating – 8/10 (Definitely worth a read. For the brilliant exposition on the parable alone)"

But the doorkeeper says he can't let him in to the law right now. The man thinks about this, and then he asks if he'll be able to go in later on. 'That's possible,' says the doorkeeper, 'but now now.' The gateway to the law is open as it always is, and the doorkeeper has stepped to one side, so the man bends over to try and see in. When the doorkeeper notices this he laughs and says, 'If you're tempted give it a try, try and go in even though I say you can't. Careful though: I'm powerful. And I'm only the lowliest of all the doormen. But there's a doorkeeper for each of the rooms and each of them is more powerful than the last. It's more than I can stand just to look at the third one.' The man from the country had not expected difficulties like this, the law was supposed to be accessible for anyone at any time, he thinks, but now he looks more closely at the doorkeeper in his fur coat, sees his big hooked nose, his long thin tartar-beard, and he decides it's better to wait until he has permission to enter. The doorkeeper gives him a stool and lets him sit down to one side of the gate. He sits there for days and years.... Over many years, the man watches the doorkeeper almost without a break. He forgets about the other doormen, and begins to think this one is the only thing stopping him from gaining access to the law. Over the first few years he curses his unhappy condition out loud, but later, as he become old, he just grumbles to himself. He becomes senile, and as he has come to know even the fleas in the doorkeeper's fur collar over the years that he has been studying him he even asks them to help him and change the doorkeeper's mind. Finally his eyes grow dim .... He doesn't have long to live now. Just before he dies, he brings together all his experience from all this time into one question which he has still never put to the doorkeeper. He beckons to him, as he's no longer able to raise his stiff body. The doorkeeper has to bend over deeply as the difference in their sizes has changed very much to the disadvantage of the man. 'What is it you want to know now?' asks the doorkeeper, 'You're insatiable.' 'Everyone wants access to the law,' says the man, 'how come, over all these years, no-one but me has asked to be let in?' The doorkeeper can see the man's come to his end, his hearing has faded, and so, so that he can be heard, he shouts to him: 'Nobody else could have got in this way as this entrance was meant only for you. Now I'll go and close it.' location 3949"

As his affairs continue to disintegrate the reader wonders if perhaps this is all a hallucination, but alas the trial is all too real.. The abstract persecution is so profound that it makes one consider wrongful accusation they have experienced as petty."
11/04/2021,b15,r4895,6124868,Tom,"Nov 15, 2014",4,"I'm always a bit hesitant to use the word 'kafkaesque' when talking about books, but after reading the last of his three incompleted novels 'The Process' I might have to reconsider my stance somewhat. It is not always an entertaining book, but it is a fascinating drive through a fictional legal system which represents the shortcomings of the individual when confronted with higher powers and societal misgivings.. As usual, the first sentence of the book is spot on. Josef K. is woken up one morning and he is told that he is under arrest 'since someone must have spoken evil about him, somewhere'. We never get to know why K. gets arrested, but this doesn't seem to matter much, since his process goes off to a flying start and K. slowly figures out how the whole system works. Whereas at first the faulty legal system is still quite amusing (Kafka really has a dark sense of humor, but hey, I'm the kind of guy that laughs at dead baby jokes so yeah) it steadily becomes more and more alarming, with the end as a sort of ultimate spectacle. I must admit the final pages caught me off guard, especially because of the relative lack in build-up, which was, in this case, a good thing.. Interestingly, Kafka never really liked this book. He wrote it after breaking his engagement with Felice Somethingsomething to keep his mind from wandering off too much. It was his long time friend Max Brod who eventually reorganized and published 'The Process' as we know it today. And I must say that I understand Kafka's concerns. The novel feels very episodic, and the good does not really outweigh the bad at all times. Certain passages feel underdeveloped, unimportant or just plain boring.. In short, what's there to like? The characters of the priest and the very start of the process belong to the best this book has to offer. I feel like K.'s relationship to the women in this book is also very important, although I fail to produce any explanation for this opinion. Leni and Miss Bürstner represent to different types of salvation to K., but he fails to really connect with either of them. Should you read 'The Process?'. Yeah, I think so. It is a very relevant book, be it somewhat 'German' in style (which might deter some readers) and somewhat outdated in approach. Still, it is a fascinating read, especially if you can make it to the end."

The setting is so strong and vivid with all of the stuffy apartments, the characters are so odd and nobody behaves quite right. It,like most of Kafka's work, is one of those books that sticks with you a few weeks after you read it."
11/04/2021,b15,r4897,9024615,Tammam Aloudat,"Dec 10, 2017",5,"On a first glance, the Trial is confusing and illogical, why would things be as they are described and why would a ""respectable"" man be taken to a trial by a court that is not the official court for an accusation that is not even disclosed to him? why would he care? and by what authority does this court destroy his life?. Thinking of the Trial as a piece of realistic fiction is not helpful as I found out after getting myself to read and reread parts of the book. What happens is not a logical story and the dialogue does not always make sense. That was the case until something hit me at one point, the trial is not real! I realise that a lot of the novel can be understood, and probably is, about criticising bureaucracy and the all powerful and unaccountable power in society. That being the case though does not explain the way events and people interact and is not necessary, neither does the fact that the novel was written a hundred years ago as the ambiguity and oddness seem intentional and the characters float in an out without having much purpose except revealing things to the protagonist in an odd way.. The more I thought about it, the more I realised that the trial is done to K. by himself, he is, like many of us, his own accuser as well as the judge and prosecutor. It is not a weird court that happens to reside in an attic that just recycles defendants who have no idea what they are being accused of and hence can never defend themselves, it is his mind, floating between the pressures of life and mental illness perhaps that drags K. through the intolerable pain. The trail is possibly a mental disease that he had the luxury of ignoring when the symptoms were mild and then succumbed to it when it took over his life.. I realise that there is no way I can fully assert my understanding of the novel, especially that many more grounded scholars have done their share without a conclusive outcome for many years since the publication of the trial. But what I know is that for me personally, understanding the Trial as one we impose on ourselves as we fail to address the difficulties that life throws at us makes sense for now and helps me, hopefully, not end up where K. did."
11/04/2021,b15,r4898,17443744,Noah,"Mar 09, 2014",4,"Having read The Castle and The Trial back to back, I can say a couple of things to contrast them. First, a word on the book's layout; like The Castle, it is not light reading. The paragraphs are very long- however, compared to The Castle, there are not as many areas where paragraphs continue on for pages upon pages, and there are enough areas where there are short, average length paragraphs, making for easier reading for me at least.. The Trial is the story of Joseph K.'s arrest and trial for charges which he is never told of. This novel is much darker than The Castle; unlike The Castle, which was at least a semi-comedic attack on bureaucratic systems, The Trial delves into the cruel aspects of them. Examples of the system include the court, where few seem to ever gain an audience to, and where trials can take years upon years; enforcers, such as plain clothes detectives and police; and informants, who, although never officially mentioned in the novel, seem to exist beyond a doubt by the behavior of many characters and by the environment of the book as a whole.. Like all of Kafka's works, there are many existentialist themes. Joseph K.'s increasing alienation from others throughout the course of his case; increasing despair as his case grinds on, with a positive outcome becoming less and less likely; and also, although not an existentialist theme, a feeling of extreme paranoia. Anyone could be an informant or employee of the court; and if not that, a fear that people are trying to ruin his position and influence at the bank where he works.. I liked The Trial quite a bit more than I did The Castle; in fact, it may even be my favorite of all of Kafka's works. It was not as dry or boring as The Castle, and I also found the characters more interesting and dynamic. Although exploring similar themes and issues as The Castle, The Trial does it in a much more serious and dark manner, showing in greater detail the consequences of such a dystopian system for the title character. Overall, a very good read, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys classics or philosophy in general, or dystopian or existentialist novels in particular."
11/04/2021,b15,r4899,84890629,M.J. Javani,"Sep 13, 2018",5,"The Trial is another ominous tale by the man who explained the frightening power of the modern state over individuals better than anyone. This story is a great reminder that for the majority of people in the world, their destiny is not in their own hands, instead they are at the mercy of powerful governments over which the individual has little influence.. At the beginning of the story, Joseph K is arrested by two unidentified representatives of the state, but is never charged with a crime and never told what he has done wrong. K is simply expected to admit that he has done something wrong because that is what the authorities want him to do. After many attempts to find out what is going on, K is never told by anyone who wanted him arrested and why. At first K finds it a bit amusing but is not too worried because he is not aware of having done anything wrong. Over time, K realizes that the more he resists, and protests his innocence, the more he is viewed as guilty by the unseen powers that are determining his fate.. What makes the story frightening for the reader is the question ""what would I do if something similar happened?"" Although this question is especially true in dictatorships, it can even happen in a democracy where people are charged with crimes they did not commit. God help the person who can't afford a fancy lawyer even in America or Europe. At the end, two unidentified men arrive at K's home at night and take him away. The two men take him to secluded area where they stab him in the heart ""like a dog."". The moral of the story is that any individual who does not submit to the power of the state will suffer the same fate. It is a chilling reminder that it is futile for individuals to resist state power by themselves in this world. The only salvation is to work in groups, vote in elections, and exert our power to pressure governments collectively. Anyone who wants to take on the state by him/herself will end up the same as Josef K, stabbed in the heart like a dog."
11/04/2021,b15,r4900,9986049,Sully (thysaltymar),"Jun 04, 2020",5,"The Trial by Franz Kafka #JuneReads. This is my first book written by Franz Kafka. I picked this book for three (3) main reasons, first, I learned that Franz Kafka is one of Haruki Murakami’s often cited influences; second, I wanted to read a Kafka authored novel before I indulge on Murakami’s Kafka on the Shore; and third, I recently completed watching the Kdrama Strangers from Hell starred by the very handsome and brilliant actor, Lee Dong Wook where the series gave several references to Franz Kafka, especially his work, The Metamorphosis.. The story of The Trial started with a narration which reads:. ”Somebody must have slandered Josef K., for one morning, without having done anything wrong, he was arrested.”. With his groundless arrest, Josef K. quickly finds himself caught up in the mindless bureaucracy of the law and the justice system.. This book is definitely intriguing and thought-provoking. With the recent events happening in the world, this literally sent chills down my spine. It is well-settled that the law’s primary function is to maintain public order. This will prevent our society from being “archaic,” but what if the law itself, or law makers themselves enact laws that push our society to chaos? How would archaic laws affect modern society?. Generally, we felt safer with laws, and I quote Josef K.:. ”What sort of men were they? What were they talking about? What office did they represent? After all, K. lived in a state governed by law, there was universal peace, all statues were in force; who dared assault him in his own lodgings?”. So who dared assault Josef K. in his home? Should we blame the officers or the ones who control them? Again, I quote:. ”But I’m not doing that, instead I’m serious about getting them off; if I’d suspected they’d be punished, or even known they faced possible punishment, I would never have mentioned their names. Because I don’t even consider them guilty; it’s the organization that’s guilty, it’s the high officials who are guilty.”. Totalitarianism #TheTrial #FranzKafka"

In my opinion it isn't teaching you anything.. The book just describes the life of Joseph K.. The main problem was its publishing date, as it was century ago.. The second problem, for me, was bad translation (from German to English). It would me much clearer to read, if either Oxford or Cambridge issues the retold version.. Anyway, recommend this book everyone, since any book is not understood in the same way.. Have a good read."

The book is fluent, it is read easily. It left me with no feeling whatsoever. Glad to read it, I loved Meursault and his vision about life and society.

The most terrifying part of all this is that you *understand* the stoic narrator - you understand his emotional distance and cloudy motivations - and when his stoicism starts to drop, and he’s forced to face the terror of a meaningless world, well, you *understand* that too. I didn’t care much for this novel at first, but by the end, I was fully on board. While not a fun read, I think it’s an important one."

There is a part of me that does not want to understand what this book is all about. Why cant he cry at his mother's funeral? Why did he kill the Arab? If I study some more I'll get to it. Maybe I wont. Please, nobody tell me the answers. Maybe we can let the sleeping dogs lie. (Dog. heh.). ""I am living someone else's life."". I said this to myself three years ago. And I hadn't read a word of Camus. I was trying to go very fast, nowhere. I didn't know what I was doing and I didn't know what I was thinking when I made those decisions.. Meursault is beautiful. In his strangeness. In his lack of reason and unanswered morbidity. Camus's sentences are beautiful. In the bleached mortuary, in the blazing beach, the bustling city, every part of this book, every particle of it is beautiful. I love its morbidity, its deserted lovelessness. I love its very lack of answers. Maybe its a book for those who never had any answers.. That feeling you get when a book is really well written - it flows like a river and it flows right through me. You love the flow and not care where its headed. And you want to not understand it because getting the questions answered would mean reducing it to certainties.. Maybe I dont understand any of what this is all about. But there was a time when I set out to find the answers. Maybe I snatched a few morsels. There is a story Meursault is telling. There is a story Camus is telling. And there is a story Meursault is not telling. Or is incapable of telling. It took me a long time to come back to the fact that this is a first person narrative. Your mother just died, M. So I'm guessing, what you don't say is the part of the iceberg that is below the surface of the water.. Such a sensual feast is this book. Surfaces, colours, smells, light, shadows, touch, heat... There is a layer of reality that Meursault sticks to. Or he cannot transcend due to his. divorce. from the reality. His narrative is produced from that gap and that I'm sure such descriptions turn off many readers, especially in the second half.. What part of his circumstances makes Meursault respond, is what my re-reads will have to look out for. He's probably Holden Caulfield's long lost cousin or something. Another thing to look out for is the mention of mother in the second half of the book. See, we reduced it to particulars and the process seems so, ... ugly.. Salamano's dog and the Raymond's prostitute next door. Its Camus genius. I'll venture to say that this book is about oppression and Mommy issues. Marie and Meursault spend the night at his apartment, decide to cook lunch in the morning. Meursault loves Marie's laughter which makes him want to kiss her. Next door Raymond violently hits his girlfriend. Salamano brutally hits his dog. There is violence and oppression. surrounding Meursault. every time Meursault gets closer to Marie. Salamano comes to Meursault's room who was sulking that his dog left him, after he leaves Meursault is. somehow. reminded of his mother. Salamano adopted the dog after his wife dies. So that....what? He can beat the shit out of it?. (Right after this book, I read A Doll's House and I said to myself - ""If the mother does not fight oppression, for her own sake, for the sake of her child who isn't mature yet, then she becomes the agent of oppression for the child."" I am not completely sure about this but that's how I feel.). Well, here, anyhow, I wasn’t penned in a hollow tree trunk. There were others in the world worse off than I. I remembered it had been one of Mother’s pet ideas—she was always voicing it—that in the long run one gets used to anything.. Nancy's death in Oliver Twist taught me this - The character died - we, on the other hand are still alive. With the pain, the loss, the dilemmas we share with the character, we have a life to look forward to. With Meursault there is something densely impactful. He is forever moving towards his hanging. But the book never reaches this scene. Even Holden would have died easily died in his story. There is something there in the prison cell, with Meaursault and the reader, and it will stay him till he dies.. I will waste a lot of my time with this book. As Oscar Wilde said, all art is useless. What does this story mean? I will wade in the beauty of this literature every now and then and pick new gems and feel alive. Meursault will hurtle towards his death and I will perhaps see clearer."

It reads almost like a satire, mocking bureaucracy and ""justice,"" along with a fictional story in which more happens outside Meursault's mind than out while we are trapped within his unfeeling mind. The ending captivated me, and I couldn't have imagined it better. You truly live another, short life in reading this novel."
11/04/2021,b16,r5212,7206839,Jenny,"Apr 24, 2018",3,"*****3.5*****. I enjoyed reading this book. The beginning is slow, and at first, I didn't understand the ""point"" of the events being described (though I never once wanted to stop reading). Once the main conflict occurs, though, it all comes together and makes sense. Besides, the banality of the first part after the death of Meursault's mother is part of Camus' message. I knew the tedium was purposeful; I just didn't know what purpose it had.. I enjoyed Camus' writing and style in. The Fall. , but I enjoyed reading him in his original French much more. There's something only an original language can convey in literature. I noticed it when I tried reading. The Return of the King. in French. As good as a translation may be, there's something that's always lost. I can understand Camus' style more as well. Anything that he wanted to emphasize turns into poetic prose whereas the daily tedium is conveyed in a journalistic (or even diarist) style.. I don't agree with Meursault's worldview. As a Christian, I know there's meaning to life and that nothing lacks a purpose. However, I appreciate the way in which Camus conveys his ""philosophy of the absurd."" I don't want to talk about why the main character is the ""stranger,"" other than to say that his attitude towards life is different from the majority of people. To explain further would be to give away what happens in the climax of the novel.. Camus' first-person narrator grows as the story moves forward and shifts perspective, so in the beginning, he's completely disconnected, but by the end, he knows what he appreciates and articulates his own thoughts and ideas much more clearly. I don't know if Camus was critiquing anything other than people who believe there's meaning to life, but I can see various possible interpretations of the court scenes and the opening scene at the home where Meursault's mother died. This could be a text that a professor uses in a literary criticism class to show how one book can be read according to various schools of thought, the way my lit. crit. professor used. The Heart of Darkness. . You could analyze this book according to a Marxist, Freudian, New Criticism, Cultural Studies, etc. reading, and they would all work and make sense of the novel (though I don't think Camus would like my saying ""make sense of"").. I recommend this book to readers who enjoy philosophical works that build slowly but make a clear argument in a convincing manner. There is some entertainment to be had, some moments of ironic humor, some suspense, some page-turning moments. It's not all philosophizing and ruminating. However, I don't recommend it if you don't enjoy those elements in novels, or if you don't like books focused on one character with very minimal plot movement."
11/04/2021,b16,r5213,71861966,Kobi,"Feb 04, 2018",5,"[The fact that this book is split into two parts, before the murder, and then after the murder, in my opinion really complimented the psychological aspect of this book and our main character, Meursault's thought process. It's quite obvious that at the beginning of the novel Meursault is naive and has little to no imagination.It's terribly easy to pick up how much his character has developed in terms of going from incredibly naive to quite aware in terms of what is going on around him. The further you get into this novel you begin to pick up on slight emotion that Meursault feels, even if they. are. minuscule. He also picks up on the little details of people and views them more as objects than as people with feelings. The first passage in the book consists of. really. short sentences that get straight to the point, whereas the beginning of the last chapter, Meurault really analyses everything and build up scenarios in this head on ways to escape the guillotine. I don't think I picked up on this the first time round but discussing it in class really opened my eyes and I found it really interesting.. (hide spoiler). ]"
11/04/2021,b16,r5214,56111743,Roman Clodia,"Jan 25, 2017",4,"I found this an interesting and challenging book: challenging because I kept wanting to superimpose a meaningful narrative to make sense of Meurseult's passivity and indifference i.e. that he is somewhere on the autism spectrum - though that kind of constructed meaning is precisely what Camus is writing against!. It's somewhat frustrating to be inside the head of a young man who is clearly intelligent, attractive, and yet lacks emotional engagement. He responds to facts and physicality: he describes people in terms of what they look like and what they do, never what he thinks about them - indeed, he doesn't seem to think about them beyond a material presence. He could marry the girl he's sleeping with because she asks him, but also admits, when she questions him, that he could marry any other woman with whom he had a similar sexual relationship. Change is essentially futile, in this book, since nothing really changes - just as killing a man or not, doesn't really matter.. Although I understand Camus' point about the 'benign indifference of the universe', I found myself resistant to the amoral stance of Meursault (contrasted, deliberately, with the immoral actions of Raymond): it. does. matter (to me) that another young man was killed - and the fact that he is Algerian opens this text up to postcolonialist readings that move him from the margins to the centre of the text.. That said, Camus does a fine job of explicating how Meursault is ultimately condemned not for his crime but for breaking the constructed rules of society: that he should be seen to grieve for his dead mother, for example, and express certain culturally-approved feelings outwardly even if he doesn't feel them within.. The ending where Camus' philosophy is expressed most overtly is done with power, especially the sense of our narrator as a physical animal responding to the sun, the sea, the heat of sex. All the same, this remains a challenging read for me: despite not needing a master-narrative of religion, I'm not prepared to accept that a human life can't have significance even if it does, inevitably, always end in death."

Who shot a man (an arab: Camus didn't bother to give him a name) only because he felt. uncomfortable. . End of the story.. Sir it is not even that hot in Algiers, to make you commit a murder. Algiers has a Mediterranean weather. I live in the South east side, in summer it reaches 50°, now according to you i might have murdered a dozen.. See that sun on the cover, that's just STUPID.. And yeah, it is unfair to put crime and punishment in comparison with the stranger...Raskolnikov's hallucination scenes were mind blowing, I was wishing Raskolnikov good luck right when he was holding an axe to smash that old lady's skull. It has to be entitled as The Freak or the weirdo. Maybe i took it personally, or maybe i once again blame it on Dostoevsky for blowing my mind and spoiling me for this one.. ""Honored sir,’ he began almost with solemnity, ‘poverty is not a vice, that’s a true saying. Yet I know too that drunkenness is not a virtue, and that that’s even truer. But beggary, honored sir, beggary is a vice. In poverty you may still retain your innate nobility of soul, but in beggary—never—no one. For beggary a man is not chased out of human society with a stick, he is swept out with a broom, so as to make it as humiliating as possible; and quite right, too, for as much as in beggary I am ready to be the first to humiliate myself."".

What difference did it make?"".. Reading. The Outsider. for a third time proves as revelatory an experience as my two prior readings.. Camus' depiction of Mersault--a man of ""cold indifference"", a taciturn individual anaesthetised by his mere existence-- perfectly encapsulates 20th century relativism and the existential ennui which shaped much of its philosophical thought. Mersault kills a man but feels neither torment nor remorse; to him it is a matter of hardly any importance: "". Nothing, nothing mattered and I knew very well why. "". Such moral detachment ultimately leads him to reject repentance and the possibility of salvation; and yet, though he might very well be a monster in our eyes, that doesn't make him any less human.. With. The Outsider. Camus achieved the best of his novels and, in turn, a profound dissertation of human consciousness. It also contains, for my money, two of the best opening and closing lines in a novel that I've ever read."
11/04/2021,b16,r5217,1792689,Amrit Chima,"Sep 18, 2013",5,"Perhaps the most defining line of the book—a line that truly emphasizes the existential underpinning of the novel—is when Meursault is musing over the fact that his fate will be decided by “men who change their underwear.” All just men. In accepting his fate, Meursault acknowledges that he has no control over his life. As he says, it will all inevitably end in death, now or twenty years from now. Those men and women who deliberate over and ultimately decide the course of Meursault’s life have only the illusion of control as they spew empty notions of responsibility, remorse, and love, an illusion that allows them to bear this life, which they are incapable of comprehending. Meursault is at least aware of his ignorance, finally surrendering to the conclusion that there is no point to life—or if there is, it is so far beyond our grasp that it is also beyond faith and belief in God, or any sorts of discussions about it. His fate to die earlier rather than later perhaps saves him from more years of fumbling about, pretending that when or whether he lives or dies has any purpose or meaning at all."

I had mustered out of 6 years in the Army Active Reserve and was finishing up a job at Raytheon there in the Kingdom. I wandered for about a year in the aftermath of the Arab-Israeli Six Day War, winding up in Athens. One sleepy afternoon I went to see the film L'etranger at a cinema near Syntagma Square. The movie was in Italian with Greek subtitles, neither of which I understood very well. I used my Spanish and French to understand a little, but translation was not really necessary with Visconti as the director and Mastroianni in the role of the central character, Meursault. It was true to the book and unlike many films it actually enhanced all the nuances of Camus' existentialist tale, which is short and poignant.. Years later we lived on the Algerian coast close to where the story was to have taken place. I met ""Meursault"" the character many times while I was there. Sometimes I looked in the mirror in our beachside villa and caught a glimpse of him in his ennui. (less)"
11/04/2021,b16,r5219,2222886,Aasem Bakhshi,"May 09, 2011",5,"Camus successfully imparts the true manifestation of relativity and subjectivism of human disposition, that is, the supposed Weltanschauung of whole humanity may be utterly pointless and absurd for one man.. But on a more complicated note, this is an amazing narrative which shows that the most visible conventions of humanity are actually its most fallacious paradoxes too. To borrow authorial intentions from Camus himself, this is a society in which a person who doesn't cry on his mother's funeral is condemned to death. Of course, at times, proverbial. In the end, all of us have to play the game and be a part of it. That too, willingly. Because, our indifference at the face of what we consider absurd is threatening to the conventional wisdom of the society.. This is a novella that would stay with me for a long time. Moving on to chew Camus and the next stop is Exile and Kingdom."

I thought the story was a bit slow when I started this book. Although the pace of storytelling was fast enough to keep my interest I couldn't figure out where the story was heading to (what's the point of all these scenes? Is this an existentialist novel? etc.). Until the pivotal scene where Meursault shot the Arab. Then the book picked up all the way to the ambivalent ending.. I'm still quietly digesting the story and wondering what will happen to Meursault. This story is unsettling and highly unsatisfactory in a good way."

This isn't only a dessert of a book for students of philosophy, but an important read for everyone who's busy looking for a 'meaning' of life. It is one of those books which scolds and moulds your brain to thinking. It demands a passionate read, and there's a probability of you falling into a 'book hangover'. In the end, you're bound to feel absurd. If you don't, you probably didn't give the book the passionate reading it asked for."

The nihilistic ideas introduced by Camus are frustratingly outdated, and the book feels like a bizarre walk through the life of an apathetic idiot.. Even having read it in the original French, I was neither inspired nor stimulated, and it is frustratingly dry.. Rather than read it, you should just clasp it in your hands and beat yourself over the head with it. It will have the same effect."

Not for killing the Arab on the beach -- which was carried out with far more motivation than I expected -- but for his total refusal to bullshit. He is a human stripped of our indoctrination to seek ease through conformity, leaving him as human as a human can be. For that, Meursault is a hero to me. And so is Camus."
11/04/2021,b16,r5225,24627290,chantel nouseforaname,"Dec 14, 2020",5,"Wow, just wow.. ////////////. It’s crazy how everything can change in an instant.. This book gave me so many pauses. I’m taking a long pause right now while writing this review and I’m just thinking about:. - how we carry the guilt of how we’ve treated our parents and our ancestors around with us forever. As stupid and as flippantly as we treat our daily life, we have an obligation to those who came before us, maybe not those who came before us in their flesh, but the concept of our past/lineage in its abstraction(?). I am also thinking about how everyone wants to make everyone else’s lives about themselves, in a way. We connect other people’s experiences and whether or not we see them as moral or immoral, to who we are as individuals. It’s crazy how we can redirect and inform our viewpoints, not on the solo and solitary multilayered experience of ourselves, but on the fact that everything is kind of intricately linked in the universe? The universe is massive!. - I think of the way that when our main character, Monsieur Meursault, is on trial he is observing all these different people in his life outside himself attest to his character and doesn’t say much for himself about his own character. I think about how if you say nothing for yourself and dispute nothing that others say about you, you become, in essence, whomever they think you are. Which may or may not be who you are, at all.. - This also brings me to the fact that many people are thrown away/put away by society, including a lot of people who are imprisoned, because they’re too exhausted by the complicated life that they’ve experienced, to stand up for themselves at trial against people who are and have been for centuries crafting a narrative about the kind of people that they are or that they come from, even when they may not be that kind of person. It’s just that they are caught in a cycle of shit and that they’re too beaten by to battle through; even though the appeal, once they’re strong enough to weather it, may or will prove to be even harder after the fact.. - I think about the people who have resigned themselves to death by circumstance, or people who were made to die by circumstance and public opinion, rather than the factual circumstances of their actions and their personal involvement and responsibility in becoming a part of the “system”.. I’m also thinking about how you may have no attachments to anyone in your current life and you also may think you have to time make those attachments to people, or to choose whether or not you want to engage in relationships, friendships, whatever, but... do you? Time is an illusion.. - Even as we watch Meursault on deathrow, it’s hard as a reader to not come to the conclusion that your card can be drawn any day, at any time and in any way. Time exists and it does not exist. Also, time will continue on with or without you (another point as to why it’s important to pay homage to those who were here before you, re: his Mother). - Paying homage to those who were here before you, to me, means that you try to understand something about/of their existence and show respect for their existence, especially if you are allotted the time to pay your respects to them. Many people are not given that luxury! Take it seriously. Put aside your childish indulgences (like cafe au lait) when faced with the reality of life and death. Pay attention to the past grievances of others, and show them and their grief respect or:. - You’ll be left with no guidance and no understanding of how to embrace the darkness when it comes to you because you didn’t value the light!. - I wonder if this is reflected in the cover art (the black and white lines)?. - Reflecting back on an above point at the crossroads of the book: it’s a shock towards the ending, when Meursault is afraid of any footsteps coming towards him and he can’t sleep at night. It says a lot about the lack of peace you feel when you know you’ve done wrong. It reminds me of The Godfather and A Bronx Tale, there’s always someone coming for you when you’ve done wrong. Meursault chooses to sleep in the daytime, as a means of keeping watch, like it matters. Outside of the fear and unrest in your soul, and what it means to enter into eternal night, what time of day someone is coming to get you in his situation.. really, it does not matter, because you’re fucked either way! LOL. I’m thinking about Camus’ capitalization of Mother and the non-capitalization father. The power that that stylistic element has when talking about the influence a present parent plays in one’s life. I love the concept of Meursault being the stranger in his Mother’s life after he chose to put her in the home, and the stranger in his own life after hearing people talk about him at his trial.. Maybe I’m in a weird mental space but this book is levels of profound & it’s very intense. It’s incredibly short but that’s saying something dramatic about the skill level to me that you can get something so deep across about life in such a concise way.. ** sorry about the meandering and typos and madness **"

There were so many things that cast a long-lasting effect on me.. This bleary court room, where people who barely know the protagonist, were making bizzare claims of having peered into his soul and understand his motives, having understood to the point where even his existence is a painful truth, something to be done away with in haste.. How pointless everything cumulated to be, if all that you lived for and dreamt of could be done away with that easily, and how equally pointless it would turn out to be, twenty-thirty years from then. Life and death have meanings not to the people who live and die, but to the people who decide their fate and walk away the next day, like nothing ever happened. Oh, the irony of it.. The detachment of the protagonist resonated with the theme of the book. People will judge you, no matter what, without any knowledge of what the circumstances might have been. Laughable but in fact, him being dispassionate contributed more to the trial than the murder actually did.. My first Camus. So glad I finally picked this up.. Highly recommended."

Despite the three years* that have gone by since reading. Crime and Punishment. —three years in which I’ve read some outstanding literature, joined Goodreads and written just over 100 reviews of the books I’ve journeyed through—Dostoevsky’s novel still resides on it’s throne as my personal. favorite novel. . No other web of words, brushstrokes or music melody has ever struck me so deeply and consumed me so completely as this book did. The author’s collection of works as a whole has left such a mark on my soul that I felt it necessary to permanently affix his likeness on my. arm. . Over a century has passed since its initial publication, yet Dostoevsky’s message is still as poignant today as it was when it was first inked onto paper.. Crime and Punishment. features an immensely engaging blend of intrigue; philosophy; political, social, moral and religious commentary, that all thread together to create a masterpiece of literature that captures the deep, raw core of the human condition when it is at it’s most gruesome and vulnerable. The exquisite literary genius of the novel evoked a strong emotional resonance in me and the timing of my reading was just right to forever wed me to my love of books.. Initially envisioned as two separate novels, one following the inner turmoil of a murderer and the other chronicling the melancholic destruction of a family due to a flighty, alcoholic patriarch, Dostoevsky deftly weaves together a multitude of unforgettable characters as they interplay through their tangle of plotlines. There are some incredible scenes that will forever haunt and delight me in my memory, such as the narrow escape from the scene of the crime which had me holding my breath in anxious anticipation, the darkly comical disaster of the funeral feast, or the emotionally charged and grim meeting between Dunya and the vile Svidrigaïlov. Each character is carefully balanced with their foil, each character is written with their own unique style of speech and language, and the novel seems to tie every thread together with such perfection and care as it churns forward, raining destruction on the lives of it’s characters to bring them toward their own personal redemption or demise.. This was a book that I was unable to put down as the words flowed from their pages to deep within my heart. Dostoevsky brilliantly straps the reader to the emotional states of his characters and is able to create seamless transitions between scenes or from the minds of one character to the next by riding the wings of an emotion. Most often this emotion is guilt, and the murder scene and it’s feverish follow-up is so expertly crafted that the reader feels they must share in Raskolnikov’s guilty burden. During the course of reading this book, I was overwhelmed by a crushing sense of guilt that was disconnected to any of my own actions. Yet, had police officers confronted me at any given moment, I would have held out my hands in surrender since I was so burdened by the guilty residue of the novel. What further linked me to the book was Raskolnikov’s illness following his crime. Maybe it wasn’t the novel taking root in my soul, perhaps it was due to the cold fall weather that was creeping in at the time, or perhaps it was due to my lack of sleep and early rising to embark on 10-12hr shifts in an unheated factory where I would work away amidst a cloud of aluminum dust, but I felt feverish and ill alongside Raskolnikov and his fever dreams. I don’t think I felt well again until after finishing the book.. I believe I read. Crime and Punishment. at the ideal moment in my life. I had spent the summer going through several of Dostoevsky’s other novels and falling madly in love with his writing. Then my whole life was uprooted. At the time I began C&P, I had moved across the state away from all my friends, family, and everything I knew and recognized, to live in Holland with my brand new baby daughter and work in a factory that could easily serve for a modern day sequel to Sinclair’s. The Jungle. . Looking back, I think I can see why I so easily soaked up Raskolnikov’s feelings. Dostoevsky shows how we are a product of our choices, and it is how we deal with our consequences that makes us who we are. I was placed in the new situation because of choices I had made, like choosing to skip class to smoke and read by the river, and Raskolnikov was faced with the guilt of his own actions. It was the most dramatic shift in my life and I am not a person who enjoys change, yet here I was without a familiar face and nobody to talk to.. Crime and Punishment. was there in my hand every morning and night as I walked between my home and car, like a friend holding my hand to comfort and encourage me in my exhaustion. It rode shotgun on my hour commutes like a faithful companion, and was the friendly face in which I could take refuge in on my breaks. When stripped of all I knew, there was literature to keep me sane and give me something to hold on to as my world spiraled out of control around me (my daughter was also a tether of sanity for me, but fatherhood was still new and intimidating at the time). Dostoevsky and his beautiful words became my friend and my passion, and in my solitude (because, let’s face it, I was very much an oddball in that factory and it took awhile to find my place there) I plunged myself deep into books, something I am very thankful for and feel that all the strangeness and loneliness of the existence is washed away by the glow I feel from grappling with my favorite authors. Then I discovered Goodreads and you all became incredibly dear to me. I don’t think I would have survived my time in that dark pit without you all, so, from the bottom of my heart, thank you.. I apologize that this isn’t really much of a review, I’m very excited for. this review. , as it was seeing this GR friend—one of which I hold in the highest regard and am always incredibly impressed by—reading. Crime and Punishment. that brought back a flood of memories of my times with the book as if I were Proust with his madeleines.

Recently, I had to make a list for work of my top 5 favorite books, which was difficult to do, damn near impossible, but I realized how simple it was to put a book down in the #1 slot. I have read some incredible books since,. Hunger. (my love of which stems from the similarities to Dostoevsky I noticed in the book),. Gravity’s Rainbow. , or. To the Lighthouse. to name a few, yet nothing has ever left as deep of an impact on me as a reader and as a human being as this book. This is a fantastic book about the human spirit, about our deepest, darkest impulses, and shows that our own inner consciousness can dish out a far greater punishment than any legal system can. Now I need to sleep and sober up.. 5/5. *It has now been eight years since I've read this novel and I remember it less as a book I once read but as a moment in my life I once lived. When I read C&P, admittedly at the right time for such an excursion of thought, it was like a companion that went along with me on a new adventure in what was a seemingly empty and lonely landscape, a friend that chatted with me throughout the day, a book that shared my emotional state with me for better or for worse. I feel like I entered this book as much as it entered me and I'm not entirely sure what I mean by that but I know that I mean it. All I can say is that eight years later no book has ever meant as much to me as this book did and I feel it more as a moment in the timeline of my life than a book upon my shelf.. ‘.

Like the OJ trial, it is about many important interconnected things and those things remain important today, even though this book was originally published in 1865.. Sure, it has a lot about crime and punishment. But also insanity and temporary insanity, the latter a legal plea that could be entered in Russia of the mid-1800's. It's about guilt and conscience, long before Freud. In fact, this book was written at a time when psychological theories were coming into vogue. It's about false confessions. It's about poverty and social class and people who rise above their class and people who fall from the class they were born into. It's about the wild dreams and the follies of youth.. There is also mention of many social theories that were in vogue at that time, so, for example, if you want to, you can click on Wikipedia to find out about ""Fourier's system"" and his phalansteres. There is attempted rape, blackmail, child labor, child prostitution, child marriage and child molestation. There is discussion of marrying for money. There are ethnic tensions between Russians and the Germans of St. Petersburg. Should you give to charity or should you give to change the conditions that caused the poverty? Like me, you may have thought that was a modern idea, but here it is, laid out in 1865. There's a lot about alcoholism. Stir in a cat-and-mouse detective and a bit of Christian redemption. No wonder this is a classic."

Crime and Punishment. (My raging, Raskolnikov-like conscious could not rest without warning you of potential spoilers ahead!). The problem with being a high school student with average intelligence is that you can get fairly good grades with fairly minimal effort. It is an invitation to cut corners and utilize only one half your ass. This happened to me in English class. I'd sit back, take good notes, and bluff my way through various tests (this was back in the day before Google, when my family only had an AOL dial-up connection and all the answers, right and wrong, were on the internet). For these sins, I am now fated to read the classics long after I was supposed to read them.. On the plus side, coming to the classics on my own volition has given me a better appreciation than having to read them with a figurative gun to the head. This has allowed me to enjoy certain works to a higher degree.. However, I don't think any number of years will allow me to appreciate or enjoy or even suffer Fyodor Dostoevsky's. Crime and Punishment. .. First published in 1866,. Crime and Punishment. is the excruciatingly-detailed psycho-epic about the murder of a pawn shop owner (and her sister). The murderer is named Raskolnikov. He is a former student living in a wretched little closet apartment. He is utterly unlikable: smug, arrogant, temperamental, condescending and self-delusional. Today, we would recognize this person as having a serious mental illness (and the book would be called. Inability To Form Criminal Intent and Involuntary Commitment. instead of. Crime and Punishment. ). Dostoevsky, though, presents Raskolnikov's malady as spiritual, rather than mental. In a way, he is just like every grad student you've ever met: shiftless; over-educated and under-employed; haughty, yet prone to bouts of self-loathing. I imagine if this book was written in the next century, Raskolnikov would have shaggy sideburns, wear a t-shirt emblazoned with Che's image, and have a well-hidden addiction to prescription pain pills.. Raskolnikov has some interesting theories. He's a Nietzsche-inspired proto-Nazi who believes that the world can be divided into two classes: an elite, Napoleonic class, free to do what they wish; and a second class comprised of everyone else. This former class, because of their elevated standing, don't have to follow the rules.. Armed with this self-serving worldview, Raskolnikov, in need of money, determines that the pawn broker Alyona Ivanovna is a louse who deserves to die. So he takes his axe and a fake pledge to her apartment and bashes her head in. The crime is suitably graphic:. He took the axe all the way out, swung it with both hands, scarcely aware of himself, and almost without effort...brought the butt-end down on her head...Because she was short, the blow happened to land right on the crown of her head. She cried out, but very faintly, and her whole body suddenly sank to the floor, though she still managed to raise both hands to her head...Then he struck her again and yet again with all his strength...Blood poured out as from an overturned glass.... Once the murder is complete, very early in the novel, the long, slow, excruciating psychological unraveling begins. Some of Raskolnikov's madness is displayed through seemingly-endless internal monologues. Is this what it's like to be a crazy person? Maybe, maybe not. But it's effective in its way, because it drove me insane reading it.. Raskolnikov's deterioration is also presented via his relationships. Despite being an utter jackass, he has a lot of friends and family who care for him. Among them is the doting Natasha, a housekeeper at Raskolnikov's apartment; a doctor named Zossimov; and Raskolnikov's “best friend” Razumikhin, who is a bit like Milhouse from. The Simpsons. , though a bit more refined. He looks after Raskolnikov, tries to get him a job, and suffers all Raskolnikov's verbal abuse with unflagging patience. I couldn't decide what annoyed me more: Raskolnikov's monomania or Razumikhin's spinelessness.. Complicating this picture are several uninteresting plot threads that eventually, finally, after hundreds of pages, merge. One thread deals with Marmeladov, a wrecked old drunk whose daughter, Sonia, is a prostitute (with a heart of gold!). Raskolnikov is eventually redeemed by Sonia and Sonia's faith. A second thread has to do with Raskolnikov's mother and sister. His sister, Dunya, has come to St. Petersburg under a cloud, though things are looking brighter for her and the family, as she is engaged to Luzhin. Luzhin has money, and a keen eye for beautiful, vulnerable women. Raskolnikov rightly senses Luzhin's ill intent, and the animosity between the two men does not help Raskolnikov's troubled mind.. On top of all this, there is a clever, Dickensian police inspector named Porfiry Petrovich. He knows immediately that Raskolnikov is the murderer, yet insists on playing a lame game of cat-and-mouse. One of the few enjoyments I got from this novel was the cold irony of a Russian police officer patiently waiting for his suspect to confess. In Dostoevsky's Russia, the law is clever, intelligent, and implacable. Of course, just a few decades later, the NKVD and KGB would be breaking down doors in the middle of the night and hustling people off to Siberia for no reason at all.. To Dostoevsky's credit, all these characters intertwine, and all the stories pay off, such as it is. In order to do so, however, there are plot contrivances piled atop plot contrivances. Dostoevsky relies heavily on characters overhearing important bits of information.. The only Russian novels I've read have been by Tolstoy, so I don't have much to compare this to. I'm not fit to analyze. Crime and Punishment. against other works of Russian literature, or even against Dostoevsky's other books. All I know was that this was a drag to read. There are paragraphs that go on for pages, and the density – unleavened by any action – is numbing.. One of the most common complaints when reading Russian literature is the names. It's almost become a cliché. Well, in this case, it's true. At least – for the benefit of English speakers – Tolstoy gave his characters American nicknames. Here, you have to deal with both the patronymics. and. identical-sounding or near-identically-named characters. The easiest task you have is not mixing up Raskolnikov with Razumikhin. It gets a little harder trying to keep Alyona Ivanovna (the pawnbroker), Katerina Ivanovna (Sonia's mother) and Amalia Ivanovna (Sonia's mother's landlord) straight. Also remember that Dunya goes by the name Dunechka or Avdotya Romanovna (but that Porfiry Petrovich is. not. the same as Ilya Petrovich). These complaints are childish, I know, and I have no excuse. Yet I feel the need to unburden myself now, as I missed my chance in high school many, many (many, many) years ago.. More confusing than the names is the culture shock. When I first tried to read. Crime and Punishment. as a teenager, I chalked my confusion up to a poor translation. Well, this time around, the translation is in the incredibly capable hands of Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky. They managed, in. Anna Karenina. and. War and Peace. to be both faithful and readable. (They are recognized, by people far smarter than me, as the best Russian-to-English translators around).. Here, again, I have no complaints with the translation; but I also had a revelation: I don't get Russians. I don't fully grasp their social hierarchy; I don't get why they like mustaches on women; and I certainly don't understand their interactions. They get mad for reasons I can't comprehend; they are insulted for reasons I do not fathom. In Dostoevsky's hands, Russians are hopelessly operatic, incapable of having a subtle or nuanced reaction to anything. Every emotion has an exclamation mark. You get Dunya trying to shoot Svidrigailov one second, and then tearfully embracing him the next. Characters fall on their knees before each other, and laugh at inappropriate times, and have opaque motivations. I am not trying to be culturally insensitive when I say I am confounded by the Russians in. Crime and Punishment. .. Of course, there are enjoyable moments, including a classic set-piece following Marmeladov's funeral (imagine a Russian version of. Clue. , in which accusations are followed by counter-accusations, and everyone is shouting and fainting). Surprisingly, there is also a good bit of humor, such as this interaction between Raskolnikov and Svidrigailov regarding the morality of eavesdropping:. In that case, go and tell the authorities; say thus and so, I've had this mishap: there was a little mistake in my theory. But if you're convinced that one cannot eavesdrop at doors, but can go around whacking old crones with whatever comes to hand, to your heart's content, then leave quickly for America somewhere!. When I was young, I often gave up on challenging books like. Crime and Punishment. . If I managed to finish – or at least come close – I treated them with snark, which was obviously a self-defense mechanism, hiding an unspoken belief that maybe I just wasn’t smart enough to get it (whatever. it. was). When I got a little older – when I was no longer a kid, but didn’t have kids of my own – I went back to those classics I had dismissed, as a way to test myself. Older still – with kids of my own who don’t have their own kids – I circled back again, a strange sort of revisiting in which I tried to remember my past self through literature. Sometimes, I found myself revising old opinions.. The Scarlet Letter. , for instance, worked for me as an adult in a way it never had when I barely skimmed it in my youth.. Crime and Punishment. , however, is never a classic I am going to love (and I’m unlikely to give it another try). Yet, in the perverse way of classics, it is utterly memorable, if only because I struggled so hard to get through it. Believing this a worthwhile hill to climb, I did not give up, even though I could have finished three others books in the time it took me to slog through this one. Heck, despite not liking this the first time, I even gave it an entire second reading. Thus, even though I can’t stand it,. Crime and Punishment. will be somewhere in my headspace forever, a vague recollection of mustachioed women,. strong. emotional reactions, and a know-it-all with an axe."
11/04/2021,b17,r5267,1413439,Stephen,"Aug 20, 2008",5,"6.0 Stars. One of my. All Time Favorite. novels. In addition to being one of the first works of Classic Literature that I suggest when asked for recommendations from others, this story holds a special place in my heart as it was the story, along with Moby Dick, that began my love of the “classics” for which I will always be grateful. So often we are forced to read the great works of literature for school or at times not of our choosing and I think it tends to lead to a lifelong aversion to them...like being forced to eat vegetables as a child...yuck.. I was fortunate enough to come back to these stories on my own terms while I was in College. My parents, at my request, bought me a subscription to several Easton Press library collections including the “100 Greatest Books Ever Written” and “Books That Changed the World.” Two of the first three books I received were Moby Dick and Crime and Punishment.. So I took a weekend off from getting drunk and running naked through Downtown San Diego and decided instead to get drunk in my apartment and read Crime and Punishment….and I fell head over heals in man-love with Dostoyevsky. I loved this book from the opening scene in which Raskolnikov is convincing himself about the rightness of committing the murder of the money-lending pawn-broker all the way through the bittersweet end and the beginning of his redemption.. Powerful, brilliant, insightful and surprisingly engaging despite the fact that it is far from being a ""light"" read in either prose or content. The central theme of this story is not really the crime (i.e. Murder) or punishment (i.e., incarceration) in the formal sense of the word. The real crime is Raskolnikov’s arrogance in placing himself above his fellow man and thus is not bound by the rules of society (i.e., his belief he is like Napoleon). Likewise, the punishment is the deeply felt, and unexpected from his standpoint, guilt over what he has done.. It is Raskolnikov’s personal, internal struggle with the evil he has perpetrated. His mind, his body, his very essence rails against his actions and leads him down the path that will eventually lead to the possibility of redemption. It is such a deeply personal, emotionally evocative journey that it was impossible for me not to become intensely invested in the story.. Something that struck me as I was reading about Raskolnikov’s struggle with his conscience was the thought that everybody does things that they are ashamed of or wish they could change. That is part of being human. It is our ability to feel genuine remorse over our bad actions and voluntarily take steps to rectify those mistakes that leads to growth and character. I think this is why I have always loved stories of redemption because it is such a classic theme of being human.. On the other hand, I also realized why I get so bat shit crazy with anger when I hear of certain kinds of what people terms ""non violent"" crime. Rapists and murderers when they get caught are punished and sent to places I have nightmares about. Whether or not it is enough, we can debate, but it is defintely not a fun place.. What bothers me are the slime balls who steal and pillage millions and billions of $$$ from people who need it and end up spending time in cushy federal prisons with cable TV and other amenities. I see these ""crimes"" as bad as most violent crimes because they lead to real severe pain and devastation for many of the victims and yet the punishment never seems commensurate. And yet, these “white collar” criminals get off so much easier and you NEVER (or rarely) see genuine remorse over the destruction they have caused. It lead me to do a little justice fantasizing and I came up with this that I thought I would share.... Sorry for the less smooth segue, but it was something that came to me while I was reading the book. Anyway, unlike those above, Raskolnikov’s story is one of true growth and redemption and is definitely a story that I think everyone should read. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!. P.S. The second time I “read” this I listened to the unabridged audio as read by George Guidall and he did his usual AMAZING job. I think his narration is superb and truly enhanced the experience of the story."
11/04/2021,b17,r5268,4622890,Emily May,"Mar 09, 2011",5,"I've come to the conclusion that Russian door-stoppers might just be where it's at. ""It"" here meaning general awesomeness that combines history, philosophy and readability to make books that are both thought-provoking and enjoyable.. Up until this point, Tolstoy had basically taught me everything I knew about nineteenth century Russian society and its people. By that, I mean that everything I knew was about the drama and scandals of the Russian aristocracy. The difference here is that Dostoyevsky took me on an educational - but also gripping - journey around the backstreets and drinking dens of St Petersburg. He showed me the nitty gritty details of life in Russia for those less fortunate - drunks, prostitutes, the poor - and he painted a very vivid portrait of this time and culture.. Raskolnikov is a great protagonist; he really is. His head is one messed-up place and he constantly struggles with what he believes in, his conscience, and his desire to get what he wants. The reader is pulled so deep inside the dark depths of his mind that it's hard to avoid becoming completely absorbed in the story. He is at times nasty, at others funny, and at others pitiful. Dostoyevsky has created one extremely well-rounded and complex character.. Crime and Punishment. shows the human capacity for evil, but also for shame and remorse. And this latter is the real ""punishment"" for Raskolnikov when he is driven near to insanity by his guilt.. I don't really know how best to fully articulate my feelings for. Crime and Punishment. . I don't give many five star ratings and I rarely feel this strongly about what I've read. I actually had a dream about it!. Speaking of dreams, I want to use this one example of Dostoyevsky's ability to engage the reader so thoroughly: I read one particular scene in the book that made me seriously distressed. I was furious, on the verge of tears, and like a child who wants to jump inside the TV to make everything better... and then Raskolnikov awakes to discover it was just a dream. I swear that my sigh of relief fully eclipsed his! But that's how far I was drawn into this world, how much I really cared about it. That doesn't happen often.. Blog. |. Facebook. |. Twitter. |.

11/04/2021,b17,r5269,416390,Paul Bryant,"Apr 15, 2020",5,"Well, what’s a global pandemic for if you don’t read the stuff you think you really ought to have read by now. Although I hope this strange circumstance will not result in me referring to Fyodor Dostoyevsky as The Corona Guy.. Those yet to read this towering inferno of literature may wish to know what’s in the nearly 700 pages, so here is a scientific analysis :. WHAT HAPPENS IN CRIME AND PUNISHMENT. Long conversations between people who could talk the hind legs off a donkey: .....................53%. People going mad and running about wildly or quietly chewing the wallpaper in their tiny room : .........11%. People being in debt :.................. 41.7%. People being unsteady on their legs due to vast consumption of vodka :.................... 51%. People being ill (physical) :.................... 34%. People being ill (mental) :...…...…...…...……37%. People contemplating suicide :...………………19%. People enjoying a pleasant stroll in the countryside : .....0%. People having a friendly chat over a cup of coffee :... 0.03%. Men figuring they can force a poor woman to marry them :.....……...……………. 36%. Women being terrified :...…...……………..………………. 39%. Horses being beaten :...……………...…..……...…...……...……... 2%. Nothing exciting happening :...……...……...………….. 0%. This all adds up to more than 100%. That is because C&P is a very excessive novel. It has more than 100% inside it.. INTERVIEW WITH F DOSTOYEVSKY, 18 March 1867. FD : You see, in my books...the numbers all go to eleven. Look...right across the board.. V. M Vorshynsky: Ahh...oh, I see..... FD : All other novelists, they only go up to 10. But I go up to 11.. V. M Vorshynsky:: Does that mean you have more emotion in your books ?. FD: Well, it's one whole notch more, isn't it? It's not ten. You see, most...most novelists, you know, they don’t know eleven exists. I get my characters all the way to ten with their emotional situations, and then...push over the cliff. See?. V. M Vorshynsky: Put it up to eleven.. FD: Eleven. Exactly. One louder.. And it’s really true. If they are not about to jump into a river, they are going to fall in love with a prostitute, or they are going to get roaring drunk because they have fallen in love with a prostitute and will later jump into a river.. CAN WE GET SLIGHTLY MORE SERIOUS PLEASE. C&P surprised me. It was like a Dardenne Brothers movie with the camera tight up to Raskolnikov nearly the whole time, and the action shown in detail almost hour by hour over a couple of weeks. Yes it’s a whole lot about th psychological disintegration of this arrogant twerp who thinks he might be some kind of extraordinary person destined to improve the human race by sheer power of his brainwaves & so therefore is justified in bashing in the head of some horrible old woman pawnbroker to steal her money and kickstart his wonderful career. And bash in the brains of her sister who unfortunately comes in the door at the wrong moment. Bad timing.. But it seemed to me that at least half of C&P was all about the horrible powerlessness of women and how they are forced into marriages which are no more than licenced prostitution. An antidote to Jane Austen, indeed.. And it was about how the arrogant twerp murderer can also be a guy who perceives this injustice and wants to revolutionise society. And to do that he starts by bashing in the brains of two women.. So you see this is a psychological minefield we are in.. Like. Macbeth. and. An American Tragedy. by Dreiser the murder is contemplated beforehand, then committed, then acts like acid on the mind of its perpetrator, and the reader is along for the excruciating ride.. Thre are hundreds of connections that trigger like flashing synapses as you go through this big ass book… Freud, Leopold and Loeb, the philosophy of the Nazi Party, Camus, Beckett…. I do admit that there are probably three windbags too many in C&P and I could think of snipping a chapter here and a chapter there to get the whole thing down to a tight 500 pages of ranting and caterwauling. But all in all, this novel rides all over you like an out of control ox cart & will leave you gasping and discombobulated.. Conclusion : excellent pandemic reading"
11/04/2021,b17,r5270,70395042,Fergus,"Oct 13, 2018",5,"Each one of us is a Raskolnikov, you know.. No, not like you’re thinking - not a shabbily-dressed, impoverished murderer. But we all share his nature. To a T.. That, in essence, is the key to understanding Dostoevsky’s tortuous, convoluted, anxious prose - it’s the one message that Fyodor Dostoevsky takes anguished pains to drum into our insulated and isolated little heads!. Not that, hey, Raskolnikov’s not such a bad guy after all... no - it’s that he is inwardly bad and so are we, potentially at every moment, bad inside - and that that that will never change.. We don’t change our inner lives; but we CAN constantly be making amends for our mistakes - and starting our life anew in others’ eyes at each moment, though never perhaps to our own complete inner satisfaction.. For our selves aren’t static and we all invariably tend towards moral entropy.. There are no easy answers in Dostoevsky!. I remember so well the time I finally quit smoking - cold turkey, 21 years ago. I was lucky I did it, I guess; but to face the indefinitely long rest of my life - stretching out before me like a vast restless desert - without smokes, seemed unbearable back then!. It was just like the Zen Master says - reaching the top of a thousand-foot pole, and then, CONTINUING TO CLIMB. In empty air. Yikes!. Panic City! The flames of utter hopeless anxiety threatened to engulf me entirely.. So I started to pray. Nonstop. Like a dog chewing a meatless bone! It must have worked... so saith the Preacher.. And I escaped from that Inferno by the very Skin of my Teeth.. So likewise, there are few pat answers in Faith, no matter what we’ve seen or heard: “Ours is only the trying,” Eliot said. Trying to make the best of a mess!. And I wouldn’t be at all surprised if C.S. Lewis is right, and there remain plenty of challenges in Heaven.. So, there is no finality in this life, Dostoevsky is saying. We can’t rest on our laurels.. Or our guilt, either, for that matter!. The best way I can sum up my thoughts on this Everest of a novel is by quoting W.H. Auden:. “Faith, while it condemns no temperament as incapable of salvation, flatters none as being less in peril than any other... Christianity is a way, not a state, and a Christian is never something one IS, only something we can pray to BECOME.”. And if Raskolnikov is not a Christian, neither are we.. But we must never give up the trying, just like Raskolnikov.... And for us, too, in time there may come Redemption.. And a Peace that passes all understanding, after the intolerable Shirt of Flame is extinguished, in. A condition of complete simplicity. Costing not less than EVERYTHING."
11/04/2021,b17,r5271,32532774,Lisa,"Jul 11, 2017",5,"What a sensational reading experience, what an unconditional surrender to an atmosphere of fear, anxiety and confusion - and to an epic battle of wills!. Rarely these days do I read with that kind of hopeless, helpless feeling of being completely, utterly lost in the imaginary world. From the first moment, when Raskolnikov steps out on the street and begins wandering around in Petersburg, to the very last pages, I live with the characters, I am part of the story, I have my own opinions, and argue against their actions, in my head, while reading on in a frenzy.. What can I say?. There has been enough said of Raskolnikov’s murky motives for doing what he does. I don’t agree with him at all, neither with the theory he proposes, nor with the idea that he can expiate his crime through intense suffering. I hate the nonchalance with which he discards the murderee - “a louse” - as an unimportant detail in the bigger picture of him, his character, his suffering ego, and his ultimate redemption and resurrection as a “new man”.. Even if the pawnbroker is not a sympathetic character, she is an independent woman, who provides for herself, without having to sell her body to a husband or a pimp. She is not a “louse”, and by killing her out of vanity, pride, self-promotion, delusion or hubris, Raskolnikov destroys her. It is not the devil’s work, as Raskolnikov says at one point. A great man should be better able to take responsibility for his own actions. It is Raskolnikov himself who knowingly, condescendingly, makes the calculation that an ugly, businesslike old woman does not have any value in herself. Of course not, Raskolnikov! Neither does Shylock in The Merchant Of Venice! Not part of the mainstream community, they don’t count, in the name of law and justice and compassion. It takes a Shakespeare or a Dostoyevsky to point that out without sounding preachy and moralist, and without siding with one character against another.. In a world in which women are property, the unattractive pawnbroker is meaningless, unless you turn her riches into your property. As for the brutal killing, with an axe? A mere trifle in the context!. But as Dostoyevsky might well be one of the most brilliant authors ever describing an evil character, I commiserate with the scoundrel, with the egomaniac, charismatic murderer. I feel for him, with him, in his dramatic stand offs with Pyotr Petrovich, his intellectual counterpart. Their verbal exchanges evoke the image of two predators circling each other, working on their own strategies while calculating the enemy’s.. I suffer with the psychopath, and take his side, even when I disagree with him. Such is the power of Dostoyevsky’s storytelling genius. He creates characters with major flaws, and very different positions, and he gives all of them their space, their say, their moment on stage. And when they appear, they have the audience’s full attention.. Dostoyevsky lets a cynical self-confessed abuser of women commit the one act of charity that actually has a positive impact on three children’s future.. He lets a drunkard, the comical character of Marmeladov, who pushes his wife to insanity and his daughter to prostitution, revel in the pleasure of suffering, sounding almost like a philosopher when he cherishes his idea that god will honour the self-sacrifice of the women he has destroyed, and that the same god will indiscriminately have mercy on himself as well, for being so willing to suffer (especially the pulling of hair does a great deal of good, according to Marmeladov, comical effect included!).. Dostoyevsky lets women sacrifice themselves in the name of charity and religion. Needless to say, I have strong opinions about that, and apart from the unspeakable suffering imposed on them in their lifetime, I do not approve of any religious dogma that justifies self-sacrifice as a virtue - in our time of terrorist violence, it seems an almost obscene attitude. Regardless, I suffer with them through the author’s brilliantly atmospheric narrative.. Dostoyevsky, the sharp psychological mind and analytic, accurately points out the difference between women in the story, sacrificing “only” themselves, and the violent men, sacrificing others (mostly women, children and innocent, intellectually inferior men) for their own benefit in their delusion that they are extraordinary, and have special rights beyond the law. And he does it so convincingly that the reader feels the urge to argue with the characters. I found myself saying:. “But Raskolnikov, I really don’t think Napoleon would have killed a pawnbroker with an axe to demonstrate his greatness, that is not the way great men exert their power. And as an anachronistic side note, in these times of newspeakish, American-style greatness, we need to ask ourselves if that is anything to strive for at all.”. It is a powerful book, and a book about power.. The hypnotic power that a charismatic personality exerts over other people.. The physical power that men exert over women and children.. The mental power that educated people exert over simple minds.. The financial power that wealthy people exert over hungry, poor, miserable people.. The religious power that dogma exerts over people to accept injustice in the hope of scoring high with god in the afterlife.. The linguistic power that eloquence exerts to dominate an entire environment with propaganda.. The individual power to say no.. Two characters, both women, refuse to play the cards they are dealt. Dounia Romanovna and Katerina Ivanovna - you are my true heroes in this endlessly deep masterpiece of a novel!. Dounia - holding the revolver, ready to kill the man who has lured her into a corner and tries to blackmail her into a sexual relationship! The most powerful scene of all. I shiver while reading. Literally! I have goosebumps! As will power goes, hers is brilliant. No man owns that woman. Thank you for that scene, Dostoyevsky! And she manages NOT to kill, thus showing her spoiled, attention-seeking, impulsive and arrogant brother who is mentally superior despite physical weakness.. Katerina - committing an act of insanity while slowly dying of consumption, and leaving her three children orphans! Instead of hiding herself and suffering in secret, she takes to the streets, forces her misery upon the world, and makes it official. She has all the right in the world to dance, sing and make noise to point to the insanity of society, which creates a platform for a life like hers. And her refusal to receive the greedy priest on her deathbed is simply divine: “God can take me as I am, or be damned!”. Right you are, Katerina!. I could go on in infinity, but I will break off here, just like Dostoyevsky breaks off in medias res, hinting at the untold sequel - the marriage between Raskolnikov and Sonia! Oh, dear, what an emotional roller coaster that must be - it is quite enough to allude to it in an epilogue to make me smile. The brooding murderer and the saintly whore, joined together in holy suffering. Brilliant, even as a vague idea.. Curtain.. Standing, shaking, roaring ovations!"

Crime and Punishment is a novel by the Russian author Fyodor Dostoevsky. It was first published in the literary journal The Russian Messenger in twelve monthly installments during 1866. It is the second of Dostoevsky's full-length novels following his return from 5 years of exile in Siberia.. Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov, a former law student, lives in extreme poverty in a tiny, rented room in Saint Petersburg.. Isolated and antisocial, he has abandoned all attempts to support himself, and is brooding obsessively on a scheme he has devised to murder and rob an elderly pawn-broker. On the pretext of pawning a watch, he visits her apartment, but remains unable to commit himself.. Later in a tavern he makes the acquaintance of Semyon Zakharovich Marmeladov, a drunkard who recently squandered his family's little wealth. Marmeladov tells him about his teenage daughter, Sonya, who has chosen to become a prostitute in order to support the family.. The next day Raskolnikov receives a letter from his mother in which she describes the problems of his sister Dunya, who has been working as a governess, with her ill-intentioned employer, Svidrigailov.. To escape her vulnerable position, and with hopes of helping her brother, Dunya has chosen to marry a wealthy suitor, Luzhin, whom they are coming to meet in Petersburg. Details in the letter suggest that Luzhin is a conceited opportunist who is seeking to take advantage of Dunya's situation.. Raskolnikov is enraged at his sister's sacrifice, feeling it is the same as what Sonya felt compelled to do. Painfully aware of his own poverty and impotence, his thoughts return to his idea. A further series of internal and external events seem to conspire to compel him toward the resolution to enact it. .... عنوانها: «جنایت و کیفر (مترجم: محمدرضا عسکری در 147 ص)»؛ «جنایت و مکافات»؛ نویسنده: فئودور داستایوسکی؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: در ماه می سال 1970میلادی. عنوان: جنایت و مکافات؛ نویسنده: فئودور داستایوسکی؛ مترجم: مهری آهی، تهران، صفیعلیشاه، 1345؛ در 790ص؛ چاپ دیگر تهران، خوارزمی، 1363؛. قدیمیترین ترجمه را جناب: «اسحق لاله زاری» و انتشارات «صفیعلیشاه» از این کتاب نشر داده اند، در 396ص، سپس بانو: «مهری آهی» در 790صفحه، انتشارات «خوارزمی»، جناب «بهروز بهزاد» هم در 626ص انتشارات «دنیای کتاب»؛ جناب «اصغر رستگار» نیز در دو جلد در اصفهان، نشر فردا؛ جناب «عنایت الله شکیباپور» در 626ص؛ جناب «پرویز شهدی» کتاب پارسه در 659ص؛ جناب «احمد علیقلیان» در 730ص نشر مرکز، بانو «لویا روایی نیا» نگارستان کتاب در 976ص؛ بانو «هانیه چوپانی» در 800ص، نشر فراروی؛ بانو «مریم امیر» و بانو «آرزو پیراسته» در 811ص یاقوت کویر؛ جناب «علی صحرایی» در 775ص؛ نشر مهتاب؛ جناب «اصغر رستگار» در 711ص نشر نگاه؛ نسخه خلاصه شده: با ترجمه جناب: «امیر اسماعیلی»؛ تهران، توس، 1364؛ در 214ص؛. داستان دانشجویی به نام: «راسکولْنیکُف» است، که با رعایت اصول، مرتکب قتل می‌شود.؛ با انگیزه‌ های پیچیده‌ ای، که حتی خود «راسکولنیکف» از تحلیل آنها عاجز است؛ او زن رباخواری را، همراه با خواهرش (که نامنتظره به هنگام رویدادن قتل در صحنه حاضر شده) می‌کشد، و پس از قتل، خود را ناتوان از خرج پولها، و جواهراتی که برداشته، می‌بیند؛ و آنها را پنهان می‌کند.؛ پس از چند روز بیماری، و بستری شدن در خانه، «راسکولنیکف» این تصور را، که هر کس را که می‌بیند، انگار به او مظنون است؛ و با این افکار، کارش به جنون می‌کشد.؛ در این بین او عاشق «سونیا» ست، دختری که به خاطر مشکلات مالی خانواده‌ اش، دست به تن‌ فروشی زده است؛ مضمون و درون‌مایه ی رمان، تحلیلِ انگیزه‌ های قتل، و تأثیر قتل بر قاتل است؛ که «داستایوسکی» مسئلهٔ رابطه ی میان خویشتن و جهان پیرامون، و فرد و جامعه، را در آن گنجانده است.؛ ...؛ خوانش نخستین بار این کتاب مدهوشم کرد. تاریخ بهنگام رسانی 02/06/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"

I suppose I just can't let go of Dostoyevsky's squalid, bleak, complicated, and spiritually vexing world, so despite having just finished The Brothers Karamazov, I find myself plunging headlong into Crime and Punishment, a book I last read 20 years ago.. I'm reading the new Oliver Ready translation, and it's wonderful so far.. I can well imagine how shocking this book must have been at the time. It depicts a world where everyone is either taking advantage of someone else or being taken advantage of, where most of the characters are engaged in a mean, petty, and morally bankrupt struggle for survival. Ironically, it's Raskolnikov himself who comes closest to espousing some idealistic notion of virtue among all the squalor, when he criticizes his sister for being engaged to someone she doesn't love, all for the sake of the man's money, with its potential to lift their family out of poverty.. ***. Dostoyevsky is brilliant at depicting a character on the edge--one whose thoughts veer between lucidity and paranoia and whose passions overwhelm him even when he can hardly muster the energy to get off his sofa. What's interesting about his passion is the deep moralism that accompanies it--his sense of the world's injustice, as when he rushes to save Marmeladov, a drunkard who was trampled by a horse, and brings the man to his family and feels sorry for them all as he comforts them and gives them money. You get the sense here of a man who deeply feels all the depravity and injustice of the world, one who can hardly stand it, and yet he's the murderer and perhaps the most depraved one of all.. And yet.... Raskolnikov is also quite suspicious of ""phonies,"" to use a Holden Caulfield term, as when he confronts his sister's fiance. Here's another complication in this fascinating character. Is he the most ""honest"" character in the book? In a way he is, but of course he's hiding the biggest secret. He constantly struggles against his own duplicity and is often on the verge of blurting out his crime. He even does at one point, yet his listener thinks it's a joke, and he plays along, but you can see how the act of dissimulation itself is so painful to him.. ***. When Raskolnikov visits the disgraced Sonya, he becomes strangely Christ-like, kissing her feet and claiming he's bowing ""to all human suffering."" He seems to take all suffering on his shoulders, especially the suffering of children, as he constantly warns Sonya about what will happen to her young siblings should their mother die. But of course this is all complicated by Raskolnikov's avowed athiesm, which he makes clear to Sonya when she says that God would never let their mother die and leave those young children as defenseless and homeless orphans, and Raskolnikov responds, ""almost with a sort of malicious glee,"" by asking: ""What if there is no God?"". ***. There is certainly no romanticizing of poverty here, as we see Katerina Ivanovna literally go mad and die from her circumstances. What a tragic and pathetic scene when, homeless, she drags her young children to the streetcorner, dresses them up like performers, and demands they sing and dance for coins, all the while they're crying and she's yelling and coughing up blood. Raskolnikov's premonitions come true, when he turns to Sonya afterwards and wonders what will happen to the children now.. ***. Raskolnikov, for all his powers of empathy, seems to long for something more--for the power to achieve greatness, to become a great figure of history--and the murder is for him bound up in this quest. He rationalizes that if Napoleon, in order to fulfill his destiny, had to knock off a few lowly people, wouldn't he be justified in doing so? Passages like this presage all sorts of 20th century horrors, and it's fascinating to see them here, spoken by this most complicated character.. ***. Hurtling toward the end now, with Raskolnikov having confessed to a distraught Sonya, and Svidrigailov overhearing from the room next door. Svidrigailov tries to use his knowledge to confront Raskolnikov's sister and get her in his power, claiming he'll take Raskolnikov away with him to America to save him, if only Avdotya will succumb to him. In a scene straight out of a pulp novel, she's shocked and pulls out a revolver and shoots at him as he approaches her, only to graze his head. But he realizes she will never love him, and even after she throws the revolver aside, he allows her to escape.. ***. Some spoilers may follow, but I'll do my best not to give too much away:. The fate of Svidrigailov was for me the one false note in the book--the one point where Dostoyevsky took the easy way out. I wasn't at all convinced he'd use the revolver in the way he did, and I felt the author basically wanted this troublesome character out of the way.. Otherwise, wow, the ending was just brilliant--the drama of whether Raskolnikov would confess or not was drawn out masterfully. Then, in Siberia, we get what were for me some of the saddest and truest lines of the entire book:. ""Existence alone had never been enough for him; he'd always wanted more. And perhaps the only reason he'd considered himself a man to whom more was permitted than to others was the very strength of his desires."". Only at the end, after a sickness, and Sonya's sickness, does Raskolnikov finally shed the torments of his ambition toward greatness--which in many ways was the driver of his entire crime. He becomes, finally, content, because he finally finds love--real deep spiritual love for this woman who'd given up everything to live near his remote penal colony. Love is what finally transforms him and gives him hope that, after seven more years, he'll be able at last to live.. And so ends this amazing journey--one that will remain with me for a long time, one that I'll ponder and dip back into, one that seems so modern and relevant today. In a way it really does presage the entire 20th century, with its exposition of how dreams of greatness can lead to sordid crimes, how greatness is a form of torment and perhaps even a form of demented thinking. I can't help seeing Raskolnikov as a ""wanna-be"" Stalin, or Hitler, or Mao, or any of those tragically self-aggrandizing men who see crime as simply a means to an end, who believe they're superior beings and are therefore entitled to use ""lesser"" people to service their own dreams. It's a terrifying mentality, and Dostoyevsky knew it well. If only we'd listened to him....."

I have been wanting to read this classic for a while and I had high expectations, but they were not met. I liked it okay but I found it to be a bit slow and drawn out. Ultimately not a whole lot happens in the story, but it takes 500 pages to get there. In fact, there are probably as many plot points in the 15 page epilogue as in the rest of the book.. However, despite this, I can say that parts of the journey were pretty good. Every few chapters there would be a high intensity event that would draw me in. In fact, if you graphed this book out with the high points followed by long lulls, it would probably look like an EKG.. Also, it was interesting to take in the classic Russian writing. Whether or not it was always super exciting, I did enjoy the feel of the narrative from the classic Russian perspective.. In summary, I would not recommend this as highly as some other classics, but if you are hardcore into completing your classic reading list, you can't miss this one."
11/04/2021,b17,r5277,30575403,Lizzy,"Jul 18, 2016",5,"“Crime? What crime? ... My killing a loathsome, harmful louse, a filthy old moneylender woman who brought no good to anyone, to murder whom would pardon forty sins, who sucked the lifeblood of the poor, and you call that a crime ?”. Just a few scattered toughts, for I do not know how to begin. After revisiting. Crime and Punishment. I am utterly troubled. What to do? What to say? In my opinion, to write a review of one of. Fyodor Dostoyevsky. 's great masterpieces is a troublesome undertaking. To write a decent one, even harder. So here are just a few toughts, backed by Dostoyevsky's own words so that I don't blunder it all. One caveat: my review today will focus on Rodion Románovich Raskolnikov, although there is much more to be said.. Ah, such fascinating despair. I had a period in my life when I went deep into Dostoevsky. Perhaps because his books made me contemplate about being human. This is a remarkable study in emotions, intense and anguished.. “Raskolnikov went out in complete confusion. This confusion became more and more intense. As he went down the stairs, he even stopped short, two or three times, as though suddenly struck by some thought. When he was in the street he cried out, ""Oh, God, how loathsome it all is! and can I, can I possibly… . No, it's nonsense, it's rubbish!"" he added resolutely. ""And how could such an atrocious thing come into my head? What filthy things my heart is capable of. Yes, filthy above all, disgusting, loathsome, loathsome!—and for a whole month I've been… ."" But no words, no exclamations, could express his agitation. The feeling of intense repulsion, which had begun to oppress and torture his heart while he was on his way to the old woman, had by now reached such a pitch and had taken such a definite form that he did not know what to do with himself to escape from his wretchedness. ”. Is it a miracle that I commiserated with Raskolnikov? That I resented his mother when he did and I loved her when he did? That I felt Raskolnikov's anxiety, and tried to tell him to turn back when he was climbing the steps to the old woman's apartment? But up he went. And that it anguished me because I new, as any reader would, what was bound to happen? Yes, his is not the kind of personality that I usually sympathize with. However, I could begin to understand him and his despair. Yes, Dostoyevsky created a very real character and I believed him enough to mentally immerse myself with his creation while submersed in his book. And this kept me turning the pages up to the last one.. “No, I couldn't do it, I couldn't do it! Granted, granted that there is no flaw in all that reasoning, that all that I have concluded this last month is clear as day, true as arithmetic… . My God! Anyway I couldn't bring myself to it! I couldn't do it, I couldn't do it! Why, why then am I still … ?”. Raskolnikoff's justification for his act was that great and famous men, like Ceasar and Napoleon, were assassins absolved by history. He identified himself with those history figures. And that gave him the right to commit the crime. How could he explain the murder? I understand he just required a belief to explain it to himself. He was no Napoleon; he was not fighting in a war. And he knew it. What he needed was a moral argument that pushed him up the steps and lifted his arms in the final act.. ""And you don’t suppose that I went into it headlong like a fool? I went into it like a wise man, and that was just my destruction. And you mustn't suppose that I didn't know, for instance, that if I began to question myself whether I had the right to gain power—I certainly hadn't the right—or that if I asked myself whether a human being is a louse it proved that it wasn't so for me, though it might be for a man who would go straight to his goal without asking questions.… If I worried myself all those days, wondering whether Napoleon would have done it or not, I felt clearly of course that I wasn't Napoleon. I had to endure all the agony of that battle of ideas, Sonia, and I longed to throw it off: I wanted to murder without casuistry, to murder for my own sake, for myself alone! I didn't want to lie about it even to myself. It wasn't to help my mother I did the murder—that’s nonsense—I didn't do the murder to gain wealth and power and to become a benefactor of mankind. Nonsense! I simply did it; I did the murder for myself, for myself alone, and whether I became a benefactor to others, or spent my life like a spider, catching men in my web and sucking the life out of men, I couldn't have cared at that moment.… And it was not the money I wanted, Sonia, when I did it. It was not so much the money I wanted, but something else.… I know it all now.… Understand me! Perhaps I should never have committed a murder again. I wanted to find out something else; it was something else led me on. I wanted to find out then and quickly whether I was a louse like everybody else or a man. Whether I can step over barriers or not, whether I dare stoop to pick up or not, whether I am a trembling creature or whether I have the right …”. You will question as I finish: where are the other characters? Where is Raskolnikov’s sister Dunya; and what about Sonia, the one that prostituted herself to help her family and whom Raskolnikov sort of falls in love with? Yes, the women in the story turn out almost consistently to be the stronger characters, the source of redemption. What about the patetic Marmeledov; the the self-centered Luzhin; the drunken philanderer Svidrigailov? They are all fascinating in their own right, and important to the story. A much more crucial issue: what was behind Dostoyevsky's novel? Where is God, religion? For that I would have to go back to his Russia, to his time and his life. Nevertheless, all that will have to wait for a possible follow-up-review, today all my effort was on Raskolnikov and how I felt reading. Crime and Punishment. .. An outstanding classic about the human essence, about our darkest and deepest impulses. The unequivocal voice of each character, the sharp study of society, the movements of Raskolnikov, of the extreme reduction of hate to the redemption of love. Ultimately it reveals that our own inner consciousness can stand a far greater punishment than any legal system can.. Brilliant!. ___"
11/04/2021,b17,r5278,111566858,Greta,"May 28, 2020",5,"“The man who has a conscience suffers whilst acknowledging his sin. That is his punishment.”. Crime and Punishment is one of my favorite books and tells the story of Raskolnikov, an extremely poor former law student in the slums of St. Petersburg who commits a brutal double murder because he imagines himself to be beyond conventional moral laws. He is hunted by the growing voice of his conscience and finds the noose of his own guilt tightening around his neck, driving him near to insanity.. Book cover illustration by Fritz Eichenberg. Raskolnikov. Raskolnikov is the protagonist of the novel, which is almost exclusively told from his point of view. His name derives from the Russian word raskolnik, meaning “divided,” representing his most fundamental character trait- the alienation from human society. His pride and intellectualism lead him to despise others, as fit merely to perpetuate the species. In contrast, he believes that he is part of an elite that can transgress moral standards for higher purposes. But the guilt tormenting him after his murders and his recurring faintness at the mention of the murders make it clear to him, that he doesn‘t possess the same traits like those who are truly superior. Even though he struggles with the decision to confess and seems gradually to accept his mediocrity, he remains convinced that the murder was justified.. The Psychology of Crime and Punishment. The novel addresses crime and punishment in an unique way. While the crime is committed at the beginning of the story, the punishment doesn‘t follow before the Epilogue. The focus of the novel is not the repercussion, but a deep exploration of the psychology of a criminal. Raskolnikov‘s thoughts, with all of its doubts, deliria, fear, and despair, are the heart of the story, the way the murder forces him to deal with tormenting guilt. That seems to suggest that actual punishment is less important, than the stress and anxiety of trying to avoid punishment. Because a guilt-ridden criminal experiences mental torture, he will eventually confess or go mad. The novel’s outcome is inevitable because of the nature of the human psyche. Besides being about crime and punishment, it‘s also about insanity and temporary insanity, which was an important political and legal issue at that time because it could be entered as a legal plea. Therefore Dostoyevsky looks at guilt and conscience at a time when psychological theories were starting to be developed.. Poverty. Poverty in 1840. The book pictures great poverty and social class. It‘s a realistic educational journey around the drinking dense slums of St Petersburg and how addiction, hunger, violance, prostitution and physical abuse was a part of everyday life. Almost every character in the novel is desperately poor. While poverty tends to force families to stick together, Raskolnikov often attempts to distance himself. He rejects a job offer or his sister idea to marry, to help him out financially. The great poverty in the novel addresses important social issues and creates problematic situations in which the only way to survive is through self-sacrifice. He even draws out ethnic tensions between Russians and Germans and hints at the question if you should spend your money to help the individual or to change the conditions that caused the poverty. This is actually not a modern idea, but was laid out in 1865.. Alienation from Society. Alienation is the primary theme of Crime and Punishment. Initially Raskolnikov’s feeling of superiority separates him from society, which he can‘t relate to. He exclusevly sees other people as tools and uses them for his own purposes. After the murders, his isolation becomes even more severe, due to his intense guilt and the half-delirium he slips into. He repeatedly pushes those away who try to help him and suffers the consequences. Finally he experiences the total alienation that he has brought upon himself intolerable. Only his realization of being in love in the Epilogue breaks through his self-centeredness that has separated him from society.. Superiority. At the beginning of the novel, Raskolnikov believes himself as a person who is extraordinary and thus above the moral rules that dictate the rest of humanity. His murder is a consequence of this belief, but his inability to supress the following guilt, proves the contrary. He realizes his failure to live up to to his own standard, but is nevertheless unwilling to accept the total deconstruction of this identity. He continues to resist the idea that he is mediocre by clinging to his believe, that the murder was justified. It is only in his final surrender to love and his realization of the joys in such surrender, that he can finally escape his conception of himself as superior and the terrible isolation it brought on him.. Nihilism. The novelist Ivan S. Turgenev made the term nihilism popular.. Nihilism was a philosophical position developed in Russia in the 1850s and 1860s. It was the philosophical view that knowledge, values and life itself are subjective and therefore baseless. There would be no objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value. Morality wouldn‘t exist and family and societal bonds were rejected. They believed, that there would be no mind or soul outside of the physical world. Closed to that is utilitarianism, the idea that moral decisions should be based on what brings the greatest happiness for the largest amount of people. Raskolnikov originally justifies the murder that way, claiming that a “louse” has been removed from society. He is completely self absorbed for most of the novel, and cares nothing about the emotions of others ignoring all social conventions that contradict that. However as Raskolnikov discovers love, he throws off his nihilism and condemns it as empty.. “Pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart. The really great men must, I think, have great sadness on earth.”. This was the first book by Dostoyevsky I read and immediately made him to one of my favorite writers. In ""crime and punishment"" the lines between innocence and corruption as well as good and evil are blurry, creating the psychological depth he is known for. Mixed with some christian redemption and the tension of a crime story easily one of his greatest creations of the 19th."
11/04/2021,b17,r5279,67897611,İntellecta,"Oct 18, 2018",5,"Schuld und Sühne"". The book is excellent literature of the highest level and can still be read easily and easily. As usual with Dostoyevsky, the characters are shaken by great emotions, nobody stays calm. The account of the murder of the pawnbroker and her sister, as well as the interrogation of the shrewd policeman is among the highlights. The story takes surprising turns again and again. The descriptions Dostoevsky everything is simply incomparable. You are in the middle of history and everywhere. Guilt and atonement is a very readable classic that lets you look deeply into the human abysses.. This book guilt and atonement is a psychological, philosophical, religious, and at the same time social."
11/04/2021,b17,r5280,2795921,Justin,"Oct 26, 2009",5,"I read Crime and Punishment severs years ago and immediately rated it 5 stars. Then, I started walking around town telling people it was one of my favorite books ever. People would walk up to me on the street and ask, “Hey, Justin, you look like a guy who reads good books. Hey, could you power rank your top five favorite books of all time for me?”. That’s an example of a real life question that no one ever asked me. But, if they did, I was ready to respond!. “Fahrenheit 451, 1984, Les Miserables, Crime and Punishment, and the fifth one is always changing. Today, I’ll go with The Count of Monte Cristo.” Then, I have to remind myself I’ve never read the unabridged version of that one, and also the list of books isn’t really in order. Also, no one is asking me this question anyway. Finally, I’m never really walking around the town anyway.. So three years ago I loved this book and a month ago I couldn’t tell you a thing about it. I knew the main plot, obviously. You know, there’s a crime and then the next 80 percent of the book is the punishment. I don’t think that’s a spoiler. I hope not. So I knew the main plot, but I really couldn’t remember why I loved the book years ago. It was time to read it again!. I quickly remembered why I loved it. Dostoevsky has his crazy ability to write about the human condition that still feels fresh and riveting over 200 years later. It’s tedious at times, not always a blast to read, not always fast-paced, but sticking with this book until the end is worth it. The characters are given so much life that even the ones that seem to be minor give you a reason to care when they show up. There aren’t too many of them and they are all beautifully written, whether you like them or not. And you probably won’t.. The translation I read made the book feel like it was written in the 21st century. Sometimes older books like this can be exhausting or written in a way that makes them a chore to attempt to read, but this one is one of the most accessible 19th century books I’ve found. I don’t read many books that date that far back, but when I do... that’s stupid. I’m just trying to say if you want to dabble in classic literature and looking for a place to start, I highly recommend this one.. Also, if you love nihilism this might be just what you’re looking for. Great characters. A extremely well written story that dives deep into consequences of our actions and what it’s like to deal with (or not really deal with) guilt and consequences and remorse. It reaches its climax early, but the rest of the book plows on with much more plot to soak in before it’s all over.. And when it’s over you can walk around town and tell random people who don’t care how much you love this book. Or come tell me about it. I’m still trying to find someone to tell about it."

Also their difficult is mere codswallop, the only difficult thing about Russian lit is the names. That's it.. Crime and Punishment. is the story of a crime and its eventual punishment. That's it. End of review. Or not. It's really the story of a crime, followed by more crime, with a sprinkling of just a bit more crime, and then finished off with a tad of punishment. The main character (I'm literally too lazy to try to type out his name) is a really fascinating character to study. I mean, yeah he's psychologically warped and is a bit ""Oh I murdered someone but you should feel sorry for me anyway"", however I always seem to find likable traits in even the most monstrous of characters (I still to this day stand up for Humbert Humbert). I just feel that I want to find someone else who's read this and sit down and talk for hours about the main character. To use a Russian motif, he's a matryoshka doll of a character. Like I felt with Emma Bovary in. Madame Bovary. , Raskolnikov (there I actually typed out his name) is kind of more interesting than the novel itself. Don't get me wrong, this novel is great and all but I just loved Raskolnikov.. I could harp on about all the themes and plots in this vast novel but I like keeping my Goodreads reviews brief. Basically, I thought this was hella good and I totally need to read more Dostoyevsky. I highly recommend this novel as well, so read it guys! Don't be scared. Unless of course you've ever killed a pawnbroker in your life. Then I suggest staying well away from this."

It didn't mean anything to me, sadly, and I didn't even find it to be an interesting story. I'm not saying it's a terrible book; in fact, I'd be very interested to hear what others think (reviews are a bit light for this book here I see).. First, I have a confession to make: I got two thirds of the way through and skimmed the rest. Well, worse than that: I flipped through and got the gist, but such is the way it's written you can't even skim. I just really had to put the book to rest, and it made me feel miserable thinking about making myself keep reading it. Reading should never make you. miserable. , so I did something I rarely ever do, and it nags at me but, well, there you have it.. The premise sounds interesting, and I had high hopes it would be one that would suck me in and captivate me. It's not that I had particularly high expectations - I didn't really have any expectations, though I thought it might be heavy on the intellectual side of things - but it was apparent from fairly early on that it wasn't going to be my kind of book.. It's Petersburg and a young student, Raskolnikov, is pawning his only valuables to an old crone, Alyona Ivanovna, who lives in a small apartment with her sister Lizaveta. He hasn't been able to afford to go to uni in several months, and his dress and manner makes him seem even lower class than he is. In desperation he hatches a plan to murder Alyona and rob her. He carries this out, killing not just her but her simple-minded sister who returns home unexpectedly, and in his fear and haste flees the scene with only some pawned trinkets and a small pouch.. His guilt manifests itself in fever and delirium, and he behaves very strangely thereafter. His friend and fellow student, Razumikhin, puts up with an awful lot and generously gives his time and efforts to help Raskolnikov; his mother, Pulcheria Alexandrovna and his sister, Dunechka, come to town to prepare for Dunya's marriage to an odious man; and Raskolnikov becomes somewhat obsessed with the family of a poor alcoholic who dies early on, in particular his eldest daughter Sonya, who had to become a prostitute in order to make some money for her family.. There's a lot of twoing and froing, a lot of agonising on Raskolnikov's part, and a lot of exclaiming. I wouldn't even have minded but Raskolnikov became such a bore, I didn't even want to slap, I just wanted to ignore him. It comes down mostly to the way it was written, which I didn't care for and which made the book a real slog.. I know this is some kind of work of genius, but if that's true, then I just felt stupid. It all seemed pretty obvious to me. No doubt if I made the effort I could see something special here, but it's like. The Red and the Black. - other people find the psychological melodrama truly fascinating, but to me, it's just melodrama, which I loathe. There's also no mystery, and not much suspense. There's a somewhat clever police inspector investigating the murder, but the game of cat-and-mouse the blurb enticed me with fell flat pretty quickly, and there was nothing left to hold me.. The blurb describes the book as ""a preternaturally acute investigation of the forces that impel a man toward sin, suffering and grace."" Uh huh. You can tell I'm really impressed can't you? It reads more like an account of a man going mad and being really self-centred, but after my sorry lack of appreciation for the equally masterful. The Red and the Black. , is it any surprise that I didn't like this book at all? If you're looking for a good story, this isn't it."
11/04/2021,b17,r5283,56939723,Samra Yusuf,"May 17, 2018",5,"If I were not to be a reader, would’ve not known the places I’m never been to, nor the people I’ve never met, it is only when we identify with another soul, we come to know our own, our caged beings are feathered and our little brains expanded as we glide over infinity other worlds so different from ours and yet alike. I’ve been sleeping with a murderer for last fortnight, in long dark hours I’ve been an intent listener and an ardent lover, to be in mind of a murderer is not a very safe port to be, Dostoevsky makes his readers suffer by the same excruciating pain as his characters experience in their doomed state, the never-ending battle of right from wrong, reality from delusion, mental stability from confusion and crime from confession leaves us exasperated and in awe of such nerve wrenching tale which with every turn of page leaves us in midcoitus just the moment we thought we had it all, in us. As life tells us he did so, it’s only through a book we realize the “why” of it, and it is the time we become lovers of murderers.. Stricken by poverty and dogged to change his doom, Raskolnikov regards the idea of robbing an old pawnbroker on his way back to the closet apartment he resides as paying guest. The subject is very simple. A man conceives the idea of committing a crime; he matures it, commits the deed, and so the punishment starts, the flash back of the scene plays in the screen of his mind, he is tortured by his own self, he wants it to end, considers confessing his crime before the authorities, and yet finds no courage to do that, in the long run goes to police, states his crime and is sent to Siberia. If it could only be that simple! Raskolnikov is the student of law and a self-acclaimed revolutionary, a nihilist to the boots, intelligent, unprincipled, unscrupulous, reduced to extreme poverty, decides to take matters in his hands for once, for him world is crowded with two kinds of people, the one who act and are named in history, like Napoleon, for whom the smaller crime done to accomplish bigger aims is defensible and even requisite, Raskolnikov strive to be the one.. “Pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart. The really great men must, I think, have great sadness on earth.”. And there is no greater grief than to be the torture cell of one’s own thoughts, no greater agony than to ablaze in uncertainty at the point of insanity, Raskolnikov’s punishment started the day he seeped in him the idea of crime, suffering never brings atonement, as Dostoevsky tried to preach, but more suffering.. Other plot threads weave the whole picture of Russia of the time, when one with three times a bite of bread was considered lucky, the time when women were either domestic hags or harlots, the time when everyone talked too much, spanned over hundreds of pages the talk of no consequence, the time when Russia had witty officers in police, who used to hunt down criminals like a tiger and yet waited for his surrender, and the time when people killed just to see if their theories were in alignment with reality. Dostoevsky had witnessed death with his bare eyes, as he faced the firing squad in St.Petersburg and was spared at the last moment, and the way he rips off the layers of human mind, lays us naked before us and the whole world to view, is of no surprise!!"

I listened to the Audiobook ( excellent narrator),. during the day- walking/working or soaking..... And read the ebook at night and early mornings in bed... or while spinning on the bike. I was living - breathing - and eating this book - little time to be online.. I purposely didn’t try to sync my reading with the Audiobook. I liked reading the ‘same’ text after hearing it. Digested the happenings deeper this way.. For my first run with “Crime and Punishment”, I think I did alright. I spent much time ‘thinking’ about the characters... and Raskolnikov’s madness.. The story and visuals - (both) - start right out.. Hooked me with the immediate descriptions- dialogue- and. atmosphere. I was getting that Russian feeling! I felt like I should go sit in a Tavern and drink. (I don’t drink- but thought about it) .. Two people are killed in Chapter one. No time wasted in getting down to business!. Raskolnikov justified his plan to kill an unscrupulous pawnbroker for her money. ( her daughter gets killed too - just by being in the wrong place at the wrong time). Raskolnikov thinks he can balance out the evil with enough good. It’s ‘murder’.. Is that possible?. The horror Raskolnikov inflicted on himself left an indelible mark on his own psyche. Or at least I thought..... I later wondered.. The epilogue is fascinating!. For a long time - I kept wondering. “Why did he ‘really’ kill these women?”. Dostoyevsky explores morality.....one that no thinking person can ignore.. At times - I wondered if Dostoyevsky was a social scientist - as well as an artist - even a spiritualist.. Dostoyevsky explored the role of negative and positive motivation and the way they played out in the moral domain: guilt/shame over moral failings.. He explored moral truth and not just moral preference.... Stimulating thoughts about. good and bad.. Most of the characters in this book are neither all good or all bad - but the scale tips to one side - then another - then another again - twisty!. Raskolnikov’s crime ‘was’ murder!! The punishment??. That takes much longer to explore.. Not much escape for suffering.. The storytelling itself was wild -with crazy dreams - drama - mystery - Philosophy - religion - psychology- murder - prostitution- poverty - love - suffering - and definitely questions about morality.. Fascinating male and female characters.. At some point - I realized - this book is as relevant today as when it was written.. I thought of the Taliban. They seek well-being in this world but their religious beliefs have led them to create a culture that is almost perfectly hostile to human flourishing.. Thousand before me have written a more comprehensive review.. It was an accomplishment for me just to read it. I’m thrilled that I enjoyed it.. I got great value - and gained insights.. Many thanks to s.penkevich. His review was so passionate and personal.. It moved me to read it sooner than later.. Except:. “He could never have imagined such brutality,. such frenzy. In terror he sat up in bed, almost swooning with agony. But the fighting, wailing and cursing grew louder and louder. And then to his intense amazement he caught the voice of his landlady. She was howling, shrieking and wailing, rapidly, hurriedly, incoherently, so that he could not make out what she was talking about; she was beseeching, no doubt, not to be beaten, for she was being mercilessly beaten on the stairs. The voice of her assailant was so horrible from spite and rage that it was almost a. croak; but he too, was saying something, and just as quickly as indistinctly, hurrying and spluttering. All at once Raskolnikov trembled; he recognize the voice— it was the voice of Ilya Petrovich. Petrovich here, and beating the landlady! He is kicking her, banging her head against the steps— that’s clear, can be told from the sounds, from the cries and the thuds. How is it, is the world. topsy-turvy?”. “And, why, why had he come here!”. Raskolnikov “lay for half an hour in such anguish, intolerable sensation of infinite terror as he had never experienced before”.. Outside his bedroom the noise subsided and Nastasya came in with a bowl of soup.. Raskolnikov asked Nastasya about the horror outside his bedroom door.. She says:. “Nobody has been beating the landlady”.. “No one has been here. That was the blood crying in your ears”.. Whoa there a pony.. Raskolnikov was ill.....not completely unconscious, he was sometimes delirious and sometimes half conscious. That’s the way I liked Raskolnikov best!!!!!. Ha!. Thanks to this dead author and the thousands of readers before me!. Wicked Book!"
11/04/2021,b17,r5285,48056505,Piyangie,"Oct 07, 2018",5,"Crime and Punishment. is one of the most heartfelt stories that I have read. Never a book is written about agonies of a human mind with so much compassion, sympathy, and feeling. There is no question as to Dostoevsky’s mastery in writing. The beauty and charm in his work mainly lie in his truthful and sincere portrayal of human psychology. But that is not all. He also paints a truthful and sincere picture of different classes of Russian society. The two elements combined produce such realistic stories that it never occurs to the reader that he is reading fiction.. Set in St. Petersburg, the main plot in. Crime and Punishment. revolves around a murder committed by the protagonist, Raskolnikov. His mental agony at the horror and guilt of his action and his terror at being caught dominates the storyline. Raskolnikov is an ex-law student, whose mind is overstrained to the point of madness by his oppressive condition in life. So, when the murder was committed it looks as if the motive was to rob; but his later actions heavily contradict this conviction, and it is not clear what truly drove him to commit the hideous crime. There is however a hint here and there that Raskolnikov believed in the extremist socialist idea of “killing for common good”.. Raskolnikov is characterized as a proud and egoistic man with queer ideas about morality. On one hand, he justifies himself of committing the crime by saying that the victim is a worthless person, but on the other hand, he is burdened with guilt. His conflicting ideas constantly torture him. It is amazing how the author penetrates the criminal mind; the torment Raskolnikov goes through while planning, at the time of committing the murder, and afterward the crime is committed, is portrayed with such accuracy that although one cannot pardon him for the sin he has committed, it is hard not to feel sorry. It is also surprising that the amount of cunning that is displayed in such a tortured mind. Through all his agonies, Raskolnikov does play a very clever game at concealing his crime and evading the police.. The story and characters all revolve around Raskolinikov; these supporting characters are chosen from different sections of Russian society. The psychological portrayal of these supporting characters transports you into their minds and makes you live in them so that every action of theirs is not read but felt. I enjoyed his choice of characters; their difference added colour and contrast to the story. Of them, I loved Avdoyta, the devoted sister of Raskolnikov, Razhumikhin, his true and loyal friend, and Sofya, his savior who shows him the path of redemption.. There are few subplots intertwined with the main plot. Through them, Dostoevsky raises the issue of social conditions and the suffering of women. His sensitive and compassionate account of women’s position and suffering is heartbreaking. Their anguish, their pain is written so truthfully in those pages that I was crying my heart out as I read them. The character of Sofya is for whom I felt the most. She is forced into prostitution to provide for the family as his drunken father cannot keep to a good job. Then Katerina Ivanovna's suffering from consumption, all the while struggling to provide for her children, touches your heart. And Avdotya's being subject to unseemly sensual attention from the master of the house where she works as a governess, and her inability to leave her position as she was prepaid half her salary make you burn with indignation. It is shocking to read how unprotected women were legally and socially. And it is even more shocking that men like Pyotr and Svidrigailov, who have the power to help, victimizing the defenseless women to satisfy their own desires. The injustice of it all makes your blood boil. Dostoevsky through the characters of Pyotr, Svidrigailov, and Sofya’s father put men to shame.. There is also a social commentary on Russian society exposing the radical atheist ideas the progressive movement was advocating and the author’s anti-radical and piously religious views as against them. He seems to be criticizing heavily on the emerging socialist doctrines.. I have always liked Dostoevsky’s outlook on life. There is so much humanity in it. And in. Crime and Punishment. it is well exhibited.. It is a little wonder why. Crime and punishment. is called a masterpiece. It is complete in every sense and perfectly so. With each work, Dostoevsky makes me fall in love with him all over."
11/04/2021,b17,r5286,48483884,Michael Finocchiaro,"Jul 16, 2016",5,"I first read this book in high school and it blew my conceptions of literature away every bit as much as Light in August and One Hundred Years of Solitude. The first use of stream of consciousness, the deep analysis of Raskolnikov's conscience, the extraordinary plot movement and violence, the perfect narrative viewpoint...everything about this book is near perfection and at the highest level of literary achievement. For me the two Dostoyevsky books to read if you are to read any are this one and Brothers Karamazov. If not for all the universal themes addressed and the vividly depicted characters, then for the incredible prose and in-depth character analysis. I don't think I will ever fully sound the depths of Crime and Punishment.. I have read it in two English translations and one French translation. I would recommend that Folio version in French and the Oliver Ready translation in English."
11/04/2021,b17,r5287,30910845,Vessey,"Dec 03, 2014",5,"""Pain and suffering are always inevitable for a broad consciousness and a deep heart. Truly great men, I think, must feel great sorrow in this world."". In this review I focus on the theme of pain as a path toward personal growth and discovering one’s true identity. I dedicate it to my friend Jeffrey. At first we would just read each others’ reviews. It was a common painful experience that bought us together and let me get to know the fabulous person behind the written words. Thank you for being what you are, Jeffrey!. SPOILERS. ""If I am guilty, forgive me (though if I'm guilty, I cannot be forgiven)…I'll try to be both courageous and honest all my life, even though I'm a murderer. Perhaps you'll hear my name someday."". How much do we know of forgiveness? It is a thing universally spoken of, asked for, preached, aspired to, but do we actually. know. what it means? Can it be defined? And if so, is there anyone who has the right to define it and give it a universal meaning or is it something each of us needs to define for him/herself? Is forgiveness meant to. erase. the act? If so, then, indeed, nothing could ever be forgiven, because nothing can ever change the past, bring back the time, make you a different person, change the reality of who you are and what you have done. But if. there is. such thing as forgiveness, what does it mean? Does it mean to believe that the committer is not guilty, that they have done their best under their circumstances? But if there is no crime, then there is no need of forgiveness. Or is this it? To keep an open mind, to understand when and where judgement needs to be bestowed and when and where – withdrawn. Or is it to conceal, to hide your negative feelings toward them and act merely on your positive ones? But if so, wouldn’t that be a lie, a false forgiveness, a show? And if we let it all out, then wouldn’t we be condemning them, after all? Or maybe this is it. Along with the accusations to be able to show them some goodness, to remember that they are humans too. And what about when we have no positive feelings toward them and all we can see is a monster? And if we don’t let ourselves fall into lust for vengeance and let them go, or even, show them some goodness, despite the knowledge that they wouldn’t do the same for us? Would that be forgiveness? And if the wound is healed? Does our overcoming the hurt automatically bestow forgiveness on the committer? And how would. they. feel? If the pain is gone, does that release us from responsibility? If the victim ceases to be a victim, does the criminal cease to be a criminal? If those whom we have hurt can make peace with what we have done, can. we. ? Which is the harder forgiveness? The one we need to bestow on others or on ourselves? Do we truly believe in forgiveness when we speak of it? Can a wound really be overcome? My friend Jeffrey told me once that we don’t get over things. That the best we could hope for is to find a place for them somewhere within us and carry them in a way that wouldn’t paralyse us and that would let us keep going despite the pain. And I said to him that if we were able to have everything we needed, we. would. have been able to get over things. But due to life’s nature, there is always more that needs to be overcome. If it is true that we never get over things, then it is because there are always new ones piling on top of the old ones. Also, what happens when there is not enough left of us to be healed? In. Fugitive Pieces. it is said:. ”Nothing erases the immoral act. Not forgiveness. Not confession. And even if an act could be forgiven, no one could bear the responsibility of forgiveness on behalf of the dead. No act of violence is ever resolved. When the one who can forgive can no longer speak, there is only silence.”. Whatever the truth, I believe that forgiveness, whenever possible and with its different faces, helps us in our sorrow, in our need, our humiliation and anger. Raskolnikov’s family and friends presented to me a truly profound from of forgiveness. They don't conceal their feelings and their belief that what he has done is unacceptable, incomprehensible, cruel act. Yet, they do so without assuming lofty position, without anger, without judgement, without coldness, without contempt. They choose to treat the criminal as an equal, as a victim in need of help, as a loved one. But can a criminal be a victim at the same time? Those are the biggest victims. Victims of themselves, of their inability to rise above and believe. But is it so easy to determine the nature of a crime? It is usually seen as a harmful to others deed. But I don’t believe that things are simply right and wrong. Not everything that isn’t wrong is right, and not everything that isn’t right is wrong. I believe in gray areas.. “You shed blood!” “Which everyone sheds, which is and always has been shed in torrents in this world, which men spill like champagne, and for which they're crowned on the Capitoline and afterwards called benefactors of mankind…if I'd succeeded, I'd have been crowned, but now I'm walking into the trap!”. We tend to see people who bring down oppressors, dictators, tyrants, as heroes, revolutionaries. And this is how Raskolnikov sees himself. It is his personal rebellion against an oppressor. Oppressor who consists of more than an old pawnbroker. To him she is part of a decease that the world is rife with. She is no a single tyrant holding a whole city or nation in her fist, but sometimes the face of evil, the oppression is not just one person, but many. To him she is part of a society that needs to be brought down in order for new, better breed of people, compassionate, altruistic people, to come and rule. To come and make the important decisions. And he thinks that if he can't defeat the system, he can at least weaken it by destroying one of its members, the harsh, uncaring old woman, and add the acquired from her to the good society, to those in need. And he also sacrifices an innocent woman in order to protect himself and his plan. And the pawnbroker herself? I don’t think he sees her in this horrible light because she doesn't want to relieve him a little bit of his debt. Or at least not mainly because of that. I think he sees her this way mostly because there is no compassion in her refusal, no understanding. There are those who make hard decisions and hurt other people but are hurting while doing so and are sorry for that they need to do it. This woman shows no compassion, no regret. And it is. this. most of all that drives him over the edge. I believe it is essential to show compassion toward those we hurt. Even when we think they deserve it, even when we feel we have no other choice. Raskolnikov kills her. And kills her sister. He believes that sometimes it is acceptable for an ""exceptional"" human to sacrifice an ""ordinary"" one in the name of the greater good. I cannot see him as simply a criminal, or simply a victim. I can neither oppose, nor side with his philosophy. All is quite relevant. I can talk of. this. situation. Do I see the murder of the two women as justified act? No. Yet, I can’t help but feeling more sorry for the murderer than the victims. Raskolnikov has a truly exceptional mind that, unfortunately, proves to be a knife with two blades. Sofia Simeonovna asks him:. ""And how is it, how is it that you could give away your last penny, and yet kill in order to rob!"". He is one of those with whom the good and the bad come from the same place. His passion, his broad consciousness lead him to both great good and great cruelty. For some reason it just goes both ways. His victims lack the capacity for such a crime, but they also lack the capacity for the good he is capable of. He is a deep, very deep person, but he doesn’t possess the necessary to bear this depth. It is marvellous to possess such a wealth of profundity and passion, but only when you have the means to channel them the right way. Sometimes the best of us is the worst in someone else. There are those of us who lack the necessary substance to bear their gifts with dignity, integrity, passion, and therefore their depth, their brilliance is a murder. They incite them to believes and actions that are far beyond our and their own comprehension. Only a healthy spirit can bear the weight of a large intelligence. As Raskolnikov himself points out,. ”it takes something more than intelligence to act intelligently”. . I keep asking myself why our human complexity results into violence, sadism, cruelty, and not in beauty, nobleness, desire. It is our birthright and obligation to be more than what nature has bestowed on us. Technically, biologically, we are no more than animals, part of the big chain, but inwardly we are something else. Something exceptional, spectacular, breathtaking. We are strong and beautiful in our intricacy, but cruel and weak in our inability to bear it, to recognize it, to give in to it. The beauty of the human heart and mind is always dual, deadly and life-giving, poisonous and healing, grand and small. And it is there that lays the biggest mystery. For it is pain and suffering that the most beautiful creations are based on. It is pain that forces us to grow, to develop, it is pain that reveals to us our most amazing qualities, our deepest beauty, our profoundest selves. It is there that lays the irony, the paradox. Our highest cannot exist without our lowest. As said in. ”An Unnecessary Woman”. ,. ”Peaks cannot exist without valleys.”. . I think it is rather notable that after having murdered two women and being incarcerated for it, Raskolnikov is actually more at peace with himself than at the beginning. The pain he goes through changes him. He might have commits his crime only once, but in his mind many times before that. Subconsciously, but still, the thoughts, the feelings that lead to it in the end have been part of him always. And after finally getting to it, he changes.. ""In torment he asked himself this question, and could not understand that even then, when he was standing over the river, he may have sensed a profound lie in himself and in his convictions. He did not understand that this sense might herald a future break in his life, his future resurrection, his future new vision of life."". Sometimes there is no other way than through our own destruction and the one of others for us to come to realize our truth. In Raskolnikov’s case the cost he pays for his personal growth are the lives of two human beings and the suffering of all those who love him. Yet, in the end he does find peace. A peace he has never known before. Because it is one thing to imagine and think of something. It’s another to face it. Only when he truly faces his convictions, by actually acting on them, he realizes their true nature. Some I used to know told me they felt his remorse was self-serving. But does the suffering make the remorse more real, worthier? Isn’t it the inner change that is most important, the decision to be a different person? Desperation drives Raskolnikov toward his crime and had he stayed in this abyss of guilt and darkness, maybe he would have gone down the same road eventually. Yet, he manages to realize the error of his ways and make peace with what he has done, and this saves him and those around him. I believe, though, that personal growth can be achieved without a crime, without a downfall, without taking others’ lives and happiness away. I have always believed that, when it comes to personal growth, deep reading and writing are the best alternative to pain and suffering. Long live great literature.. P.S. I would also like to thank my friend Sidharth who really does understand and appreciate the connection between beauty and pain and whose words about it were a part of what inspired me to write this. Thank you, Sidharth. You are a very wise young man. :). Read count: 1"
11/04/2021,b17,r5288,16587936,Jr Bacdayan,"Apr 19, 2013",5,"I do not know how to begin, I am utterly troubled. What to do? What to say? In my opinion, to write a review of Dostoyevsky's great masterpiece is a very hard undertaking. To write a decent one, even harder. A week ago, if you asked me what my favorite novel was, I'd greatly struggle with it. I might consider Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Nabokov's Lolita, or probably even Heller's Catch 22. I might give varying answers. It would probably depend on my mood, or the current focus of my stream of thoughts. But, alas! Now, now I have found it! A book, unquestionable enough to be the greatest novel and work of fiction that I have read. As I say this, please bear in mind that I have humbly read very few of the novels I intend to read. Let us say that I'm still a novice of the classical greats. Call me a classical dunce, if you must. I have scarcely pierced through the surface of the greatest literary works. Scarcely. So forgive me, if you think that I overpraise this. Bear with me. Deal with me as a wise and knowing adult would deal with an inquisitive child. What I ask for, is your indulgence, if you can give it to me.. Crime & Punishment. Two words. Cause & effect. Low & High. Evil & Justice. Two words that are intertwined, knitted cheek by jowl, and always associated with the other. Two words that are close yet far as possible. The title's two words is reflective of Dostoyevsky's great masterpiece itself. Of course, it certainly is about the psychology of a crime and the punishment it measures. But more than that, the novel features exceedingly contrasting views. These views, contrasting and even paradoxical, can sincerely confuse a man. But, these seemingly contrasting views when scrutinized is really just the product of a struggle inside a man's very being. A man's final struggle of whether to finally detach himself from society, from life, from his humanity, or to finally succumb to it. These struggles, or contradictory ideas can be noted several times in the book. We have Raskolnikov's Napoleonic belief that he is of the elite, and should step over obstacles without being affected even if blood is involved, as was hinted in his article. Then, later on he would admit to Sonya that he was not of the elite since he was terribly affected. But again, when he was in prison he would declare that he was not there because he was guilty of anything but rather because he was weak and confessed. Also, we have his being generous and charitable. He would give Marmaladov's widow, Katarina Ivanovna, all the remaining 25 rubles his mother sent him. Then there was his helping of his schoolmate and the crippled father, and the saving of two children in the fire. Here was a man acting as a savior to strangers yet could not even bear to look and much less talk with his mother and sister. Here was a man who believed that anything could be sacrificed for the success of his career, who killed two women yet refused that her sister be wed to a rich man for his sake. Here was a man who regarded religion as nonsense yet read the gospel and asked people to pray for him. Here was a man who didn't care if he died, didn't eat, didn't care about his illness, yet refused to commit suicide. Here was a man suffering. A man, who because of his crime, suffered his punishment of madness, of guilt, of never ending anxiety and anxiousness. I fancy that Dostoyevsky reiterates that this punishment that goes on through a criminal's mind is far more potent than the punishment of being contained in four walls. As he pointed out in the epilogue, that in prison, the convicts valued life much more. While in this state of madness, of insane ecstasy. A man would undergo extreme suffering and lose his mind and matter. In the words of Sonya, ""Oh, what suffering! What suffering!"". “The man who has a conscience suffers whilst acknowledging his sin. That is his punishment.”. This struggle inside Raskolnikov, is enhanced by his intellect. He cannot help but disdain what is going on inside him. His reason rejects his will. If anything, the more intellectual you are, the more you are prone to detach from your surroundings. You reason that feelings and relations are merely nonsensical. You think of dialectics instead of breathing fresh air. “Pain and suffering are always inevitable for a large intelligence and a deep heart. The really great men must, I think, have great sadness on earth.”. As I give my conclusion, let me also give some remarks about my feelings towards the end of the book. It is hard not to root for a happy ending. I was glad that Rasumikhin and Dunya had gotten theirs. And after such pain and suffering, I have forgiven Raskolnikov and want for him peace of mind too. His final realization that he indeed had love for Sonya brought me intense joy. I do not know why. Maybe it was empathy, if anyone deserved happiness it was Sonya. Sonya whose happiness was only through Raskolnikov. Here was a Murderer and a Harlot. Two shameful transgressors who believed that their transgressions were justified. One out of vanity, the other out of charity. One who is vile and contemptuous, the other loving and loyal. Bound together by some irreversible force of nature. Intertwined. Like the words Crime and Punishment, Raskolnikov and Sonya are two people who are far different but are bound together. They are allegories of the words themselves. Raskolnikov stands for Crime. He is a murderer who is unrepentant, he is contemptuous, menacing, vain, and indifferent. A man who believes he is above the law. All for self-gain. Sonya stands for Punishment. She is true, loving, loyal, charitable, a woman who deserved richly but lived poorly. A call for justice. Raskolinkov and Sonya, two utterly different people that are connected by suffering. Raskolnikov is crime, he cannot atone himself no matter what he does. Sonya is the atoning punishment. Only through Punishment, can Crime be atoned. Only through Sonya, can Raskolnikov atone himself.. This enduring masterpiece is a beauty to behold. A complex, broad, and psychological mastery of not only crime and punishment but also of life, death, sacrifice, society, intellect, love, and ultimately renewal and hope. As I end this review, let me leave you with these excerpts.. ""Go now, this minute, stand in the crossroads, bow down, first kiss the earth you've defiled, then bow down to the whole world, on all four sides, then say aloud to everyone: 'I have killed!' "". ""Accept suffering and redeem yourself by it, that's what you must do."". ""He went on down the stairs and came out in the courtyard. There in the courtyard, not far from the entrance, stood Sonya, pale, numb all over, and she gave him a wild, wild look. He stopped before her. Something painted and tormented, something desperate, showed in her face. She clasped her hands. A hideous, lost smile forced itself in his lips. He stood a while, grinned, and turned back upstairs to the office."". ""But all at once, in the same moment, she understood everything. Infinite happiness lit up in her eyes; she understood, and for her there was no longer any doubt that he loved her, lover her infinitely, and at last the moment had come... """

The really great men must, I think, have great sadness on earth.”. In the streets of glorious and troubled St. Petersburg, the shadow of a man is wandering aimlessly. He has committed murder by killing a pawnbroker who was evil incarnate. No one would miss her. There is not a single being on Earth that was benefited by her presence. The Devil himself would fear her. So, her blood money can be put to good use, for honest deeds, for relieving the torment of others in an era where poverty and destitution were at large.. But there is no peace. As guilt grows and grows, Raskolnikov’s mind descents in an abyss of coldness, doubt, remorse and paranoia. And alongside him, we begin to wonder. Is murder justifiable? Is killing an evil person a righteous act? Do we have the right to ignore balance and take the law into our hands? Do we have the right to feel so superior, so intelligent and strong that we can deal with the results of such an action? And even if we escape unscathed, do we have the required resilience to drive the Furies away? Will have a Sonya to confide in, someone who will support us and share the difficult road towards punishment? Will we have the determination to fight against the Luzhins and Svidrigailovs of the world?. For me, the answer is yes. For others, it may be different. It is for us to decide the depth of the crimes and the severity of the punishments..

Some reviews I write in part for others; some of them I write mainly for myself, as a kind of autobiography of my reading. This I put in the latter category though if you have read it, tell me what you think of what I think.. So, most people who have never even read this book already know from the simple title that a crime has been committed, and most probably know a guy kills a woman or two. Then we know there is a punishment that follows the crime. Simple. You need 500 plus pages to tell that?! The short answer is yes.. But the crime is basically what happens in the first hundred or so pages, and we don’t know why, really. We never get a good reason, actually, which is also part of the point. A guy named Raskolnikov kills his pawnbroker Alyona and robs her, though he never does anything with what he steals. In the process, his daughter Lizaveta walks in so he kills her, too. So that’s the crime. The last 4/5 of the book is in part about the “punishment” which unless you omit the short epilogue, does not involve institutional punishment. The last 4/5 focuses on psychological and spiritual self-punishment or what Dostoevsky always refers to as “suffering.” And various considerations of what Dostoevsky never calls sin in a parade of wild and wonderful characters.. At the outset of the novel, we learn that former college student Raskolnikov lives in St. Petersburg, in relative poverty, spinning his wheels, drinking and hanging with women (or, whoring, though this is the nineteenth century, so the references here are vague, usually) (things that we know Dostoevsky also did much of his life, in addition to gambling). As things proceed we see Rask has published an essay about how there are some people, usually great ones, who are “above the law,” people who can do whatever they want and get away with it.. Nietzsche, a nineteenth century philosopher, called such folks “supermen,” those who rise above the moral precepts of the time to achieve greatness or just to prove that moral systems do not apply to them. This might begin to summarize simply the moral position of Nietzsche: You have your way. I have my way. As for the right way, the correct way, and the only way, it does not exist.. In other words, there’s no God, and no religious or ethical system that must apply to all people.. Rask commits the murders in part as a way of working out this stupid theory, though he is poor and at the very least could also use the cash he steals, but never does. So why care about this idiot, you ask? Well, read on.. Rask needs the money, but when he has it, he tends to give it away to others. Not that he is a really a good guy; he is a murderer, but he has some charitable aspects to his character revealed from time time. There's some goodness that shines through the grime. Sometimes he despicably tries to dismiss his murders as trivial, sometimes we see that the woman he murders is not likable in any sense, but he never gets off the hook for it, ever, especially with himself. This is not an isolated thing, this murder for philosophical principle, by the way. In the twentieth century, the two teenagers Leopold and Loeb read Nietzsche and just to test the theory killed a kid randomly in Chicago, and they fried (yes, were electrocuted) for it. They had the same thing in mind: Great men can do Whatever They Want and not experience Guilt. They will rise above ethics, they think or, as most novelists and moralists decide, sink below it. The theory is an empty one, of course, as most humans with any commons sense would see, but intellectuals, eh, Dostoevsky (D, hereafter), they are kinda blowin' in the winds of theoretical fashion. Arrogant, they all think they wanna be Napoleon. Which is kinda Dostoevsky's point about the moral universe, but I'm getting ahead of myself.. Anyway, Rask is painfully aware his mother and sister will do anything to help him financially. And he’s maybe in love with prostitute Sonya, who is doing this terrible work to make money for her family. He fears his own sister (Dunya) will do similar sorts of prostituting (she has already, for instance, agreed to marry rich jerk Luzhin, just to help out the family that has gone poor supporting student Rask; this is one sub-theme, how women are reduced in the [Russian] patriarchal economic system). But he never does anything with money except give some that he has to Sonya's family, left destitute at the death of their drunken father, Marmeledov. So he's strange and mostly unlikable, our anti-hero Rask, though he is fascinating always and even a little likable sometimes to me, as I am also [pretty] [okay, a lot] fallible myself, so I have empathy for him sometimes.. Later, we might see a kind of “moral” in this story about a man like RASK who doesn’t believe in God, from Dostoevsky through Nietzsche: He who fights with monsters might take care lest he thereby become a monster. And if you gaze for long into an abyss, the abyss gazes also into you. [Nietzsche]. That happens to Rask, and others in this book. They suffer, facing their demons or monsters.. And no one depicts suffering like Dostoevsky. His predecessor and mentor in Russian literature, Gogol, also knew suffering, though while he is similarly recognized for creating poor folk grotesques, Gogol's are often comic. D references and creates tributes to his Master in this work, but most people don’t see D’s grotesque, suffering folks as all that funny. D does sad better than funny. In this reading, I saw some characters as (darkly) funny sometimes, however. There’s satire throughout, especially of the upper classes. D and literature in general don't usually make fun of the poor with any success. The drunken Marmeledov, for instance, is pathetic, but he's also hilarious and insightful and finally tragic. He’s a full and rich and complex character.We see poverty and its attendant horrors in many ways in this book, and we come to care about them and their needs. They suffer and we can see this is central to humanity. In some ways you become close to saints in your suffering. This is certainly true for Sonya, one of the several notable ""madonna-whore"" women characters in literary history.. There’s some action in this book, of course; in fact it is sometimes quite the page turner as we wonder what is going to happen, is Rask going to get caught, and so on, and in this sense it has the feel of a murder mystery where the suspense is whether he gets caught, but the centerpiece in this book (besides the moral wrangling) is dialogue in the service of character, and it works breath-takingly well here. The talk is stunning. Most of the male characters are tortured drunken philosophizers who go on page after page speaking their madness and grief. And most of these crazy flawed folks are indeed men doing most of the talking. The women are less crazy, and less flawed, on balance, and mostly crazy BECAUSE of the men. Surprise, surprise. But the talk is amazing, it is the heart of the book as narrative creation. When men drink and talk, they are passionate, he has that down, (actually, this book came out of a failed attempt at a draft he called The Drunks!), but the ideas that flow from their mouths, the thinking about the meaning of life, the struggles with love and morality, all this is incredible. I mean it, no irony here. Some of the best writing ever, and about poor folks, sometimes even despicable folks, that he makes you care for! Is it their fault they are in such destitution? Well, sometimes, yes. See above.. Does it go on a bit long, like this [undrunken] review? Some say yes, but not for me. We need to know what is going to happen and why for Rask, but we also need to broaden the lens and see others who are also suffering in their own ways. We need foils for understanding Rask in a sociological sense. Luzhin, the self-centered lawyer who is for a time engaged to Dunya, he’s a world class jerk, but an interesting one. While Rask is never excused for his murders, these other men and their iniquities help us see what can be some goodness at times in Rask, and appreciate the remarkable end of the book.. The also drunken philanderer Svidrigailov is a (drunken, of course) jerk, but he also takes care of Marmeledov’s consumptive widow, and after her horrific death, her children, including her step-daughter Sonya (she’s the one who has become a prostitute to help her family, whom Rask sort of falls in love with, though simultaneously torments from time to time) {of course. Because this is what relationships sometimes are) in part because he is trying to bribe her into marriage. He also tries to bribe Rask’s sister Dunya into marriage, though he is already engaged, and fails. He becomes a central character in the book because he (BIG spoiler) makes the decision to commit suicide, which makes him a foil to Rask, who contemplates this, but instead, Rask chooses confession, hard labor in Siberia with Sonya able to come north with him and visit regularly.. Another great character is the Columbo-like (look it up! You have google! Peter Falk!) bumbling and rumpled old genius detective Porfiry, who finally convinces Rask to confess and give himself up. Rask’s great friend Razumikhin is wonderful in defense of Rask against all evidence to the contrary, who also agrees to take care of his sister and mother. He’s a strange man, also a drunk (D knows drunkenness, it’s clear) but good where most men are not in this book.. The story is one of final and not easily achieved redemption, but we only see this in the very final pages of this long novel, as he finally fully accepts the love of Sonya, and understands it as a model for living. Sonya is the moral center of the book, with her unwaivering and not easily achieved faith in God. She’s convincingly Good (okay, this might be hard to support, in one sense, but she is the closest thing to God's Unconditional Love we got in this tome).. Rask's sister Dunya and their mother are also good, giving up everything for her love of her son. Nastasya cares for Rask, too, She's also wholly good. The late goodbye scene between Rask and his mother is affecting and powerful. The scenes between Rask and (totally good) sister Dunya are powerful, too. Do you see a pattern here? Sure, Sonya is a prostitute, but only in necessity for her destitute family. Women are often saints here, they make the right choices, or most of them do. Maybe that is a flaw, that D deifies women; this is a kind of cliché. But there are a couple weak and wicked women in this book, too. The women don't always seems quite as real as the men sometimes because they are a little one-dimensionally good, but they are still great, they seem real to me.. But it is LOVE that redeems Raskolnikov, the love of a woman, Sonya, and his mother and sister, too, but mainly Sonya, and while it seems like a stretch she would care for him, she does, and both he and we come to believe in her goodness and love.. Some favorite scenes? Sonya’s reading of the Biblical Lazurus story to Rask is ELECTRIC, unforgettable. The best scene in the whole book, for my money. I was once religious and I know that passage from the Bible; I say now that I am agnostic, but that scene, that felt like an indictment, a promise to me, in my own lost-soul-ness. The scenes with Porfiry are great and the scene in particular where Porfiry finally accuses Rask is also ELECTRIC, I promise, as is the final scene of the book. The lyrical final scenes with Svidrigailov are wonderful, powerful and surprising; I had NO idea he was going to do that. Anytime Mom and Rask or Dunya and Rask are talking with each other, these scenes are deeply poignant, trust me. Marmeledov's drunken talk with Rask is wonderfully comic early on.. When I first read this book I was “churched” in a Calvinism that seemed darkly consistent with Dostoevsky’s dark, angsty world view. Later, I came to like the work of D-influenced South African writer J. M. Coetzee, who actually wrote his novel The Master of St. Petersburg about Dostoevsky (yes, very much worth reading!). I still love these writers, though my views on matters of faith have shifted considerably. But as a veteran doubter, I liked D’s anguished struggles with faith and the meaning of life more than anyone else’s writing and thinking. And they once led me, in my existentialist period, into Kafka, Sartre, Camus, and others. Camus’s The Stranger and Kafka’s “Metamorphosis” owe things to C & P.. Hamlet and Macbeth are anguished precursors, as is D’s own “Underground Man."" Anyway, doubt and anguish have always seemed more interesting to me than joyful faith and happiness, and still do. I think the world is more complicated than mere celebration, though I have much to celebrate, too. But the world is a dark place just now, as I see it, with a lot of ugliness in it. Dostoevsky resonates with the present for me as much as it ever did.. C & P is as much a psychological and sociological novel (about various forms of “madness” in nineteenth century Russia) as it is a philosophical renunciation of nihilism, though it is richly both, and much worth reading for these aspects. It’s a real thriller, too, a cat and mouse story with the focus on Rask and his interior experience of suffering, but it is also a novel the literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin would identify as a “cultural forum” on issues in D's times in Russia. Raskolnikov is a jerk, a wonderfully reprehensible character that D refuses to sentimentalize, but as much as we despise him for some of his ridiculous youthful views—his ideas about the superman display the worst of the intellectualism of his times—we also come to appreciate him in various ways. Dostoevsky is a thinker, but he is first and foremost a poet of the heart and what might still be called “soul” unapologetically.. The translation by Pevear and Volokhonsky is supposedly the best ever, much lauded, and I can’t say, not speaking the language, but it was fabulous to read. I read the Constance Garnett version 40 years ago. This is the one to read now, everyone says, so choose this one if you are going to read or reread. I also have read in the past couple years their translations of Anna Karenina and Underground Man and Brothers Karamazov, so I can attest they are wonderful writers/interpreters.. Finally, yes, it is (again) one of the best things I have ever read, and I highly recommend it. You may find it a tad long for contemporary tastes, but hey, you also have David Foster Wallace, who is very long. Pynchon is long. Ulysses was long. Sometimes great things are long! And maybe he is too nineteenth century modernist for you, finally. But for me he is great, deserving of his high status in the canon of world literature. It is just one hell of a read."
11/04/2021,b17,r5459,3633494,Laura Leaney,"Feb 12, 2016",5,"I love this book. Re-reading this particular translation did nothing to diminish my admiration for the novel or for the author. The Pevear/Volokhonsky might be a little easier to follow than the Monas version, and perhaps a little less ornate in style, but it's fine reading. Every time I read anything by Dostoyevsky, I find something new and valuable. Now, Oliver Ready has a new translation out on the shelves. It will not hurt me to read it again.. Out of the mouth of the criminal Raskolnikov comes the following statement, which may as well be applied to. Crime and Punishment. itself: ""Russian people are generally broad people [. . .] broad as their land, and greatly inclined to the fantastic, the disorderly; but it's disastrous to be broad without special genius."" Indeed, the novel feels like an explosion, but underneath the chaos is a complex series of patterns that illuminates the nature of human desire. Thanks to the genius of Fyodor Dostoyevsky..

The timeline is distorted and feels like one step forward to steps back changing between the many characters and events. Halfway through there is a shift in focus of the main players and events and things start to make more sense. The author really wanted to show or point out certain circularity of history and characters and while that is an interesting topic I didn't like that we couldn't discover it for ourselves as we were constantly hit over the head with the author telling us what he was doing.. This might pay off for a deep analysis and study group, but not as a pleasure read.. Also totally did not get the solitude part, it was mentioned a lot, but it didn't feel like it."

Rereading novels twenty or so years apart should, you would think have different effect/affects upon your reading compendium, as in your encompassed life to that point, reading itself being a central aspect of living. Well, and it does; rereading several classics like ""Crime and Punishment"" and ""One Hundred Years Of Solitude"" now as sexagenarian reads cleaner yet more complex given my own gathered reading intelligence quotient, but still dazzled with the more opened doors of perception sanctioned by life-long seeking. My ego wants to downsize these masterpieces while Id the kid says 'no, we need these storied myths to feed our desires of Nietzschean will to power powers.' To hell w/supra-e-gore anyway aye!

""Right there across the river there are all kinds of magical instruments while we keep on living like donkeys"". . The insomnia plague. General Moncada. ""What worries me is that out of so much hatred for the military, out of fighting them so much and thinking about them so much, you’ve ended up as bad as they are. And no ideal in life is worth that much baseness"". . The rise of Colonel Aureliano Buendia. The fall of Colonel Aureliano Buendia. ""Lost in the solitude of his immense power, he began to lose direction"". . The disillusionment of Colonel Aureliano Buendia. ""He had had to start thirty-two wars and had had to violate all of his pacts with death and wallow like a hog in the dungheap of glory in order to discover the privileges of simplicity almost forty years late"". . The loss of hope. ""He had not shaved, more tormented by the pain of the sores than by the great failure of his dreams, for he had reached the end of all hope, beyond glory and the nostalgia of glory"". .

11/04/2021,b18,r5888,4922926,Elise,"Feb 17, 2011",5,"2017 review:. I just finished reading this, my favorite novel, a third time, and I love it even more, which I didn't think was even possible. If I had to live on deserted island alone for the rest of my days and could only take one book with me, One Hundred Years of Solitude would be my choice. Not only is Garcia Marquez's language gorgeous, but he surprises us with strange, rich, and beautiful details in almost every single sentence. I will never tire of reading this great book, and I suspect I will read it many times more in my lifetime. Yes, it's that good. It is a richly allusive epic tale about stories, about how history is written through a combination of truth, obfuscation, myth, and legend. It is world history in microcosm and Marquez is the 20th century's Homer (note allusions to The Odyssey in its pages as well). One Hundred Years of Solitude is the story of enchantment that pulls readers along with every line like Melquiades' ingots. For, how else could GG Marquez reveal so much horror and truth and keep us reading--humor and beauty, that's how. I love this book, this fanciful and faithful way of viewing the human condition, and I love Gabriel Garcia Marquez for weaving this gorgeous tapestry for us to lose ourselves in and for refusing to allow this masterpiece to be made into a movie because he respected his readers' imaginations too much and wasn't motivated by greed, as so many authors today are. Readers who complain about not being able to keep characters' names straight are both not paying attention to Marquez's character development (which erased most of that initial confusion for me) and are missing the point of this book entirely. Control is an illusion (one major theme in my opinion), so just get lost and enjoy the magic carpet ride a la Melquiades. To read this one any other way is to cheat yourself out of a sublime literary experience.. 2014 review follows:. I reread this one twenty years after reading it the first time, and I was drawn in, enchanted, and blown away all over again by Garcia Marquez's gorgeous prose and dazzling setting and character development. After this rereading, I was reminded why ""One Hundred Years of Solitude"" is one of the pivotal works that changed my life. It transformed my view of the world, revealing the magic and the strange, deranged beauty beneath our often sad, ugly, and demented history, and that way of seeing in itself, buouys us up, gives hope and meaning to all of our strivings, regardless of the destructive legacies we sometimes inherit or bequeath. Macondo may be a world born of Garcia Marquez's imagination, but it is true to life, bursting with wisdom, passion, longing, and honesty. In my opinion, ""One Hundred Years of Solitude"" is the best novel ever written. Ever since Gabriel Garcia Marquez passed away last week, I have grieved for the loss of a great man, a literary genius, and what seems almost like a best friend, but most of all, with Gabo's passing, I grieve for a world that has lost a great deal of its magic and its soul."
11/04/2021,b18,r5889,762235,Marcus,"Aug 08, 2012",2,"I just didn't get this book. Some of that, I'm sure, comes from the fact that I read it in Spanish, and while I like to tell myself that I speak excellent Spanish, reality would probably wound my ego, so I'm going to ignore that and focus on the book itself.. The plot--it moves so fast you feel like you're a dog with your head out the window of a car on a Utah freeway, the only ones where you can go 80 legally. You're driving through the state and trying to take in everything you see but it's just moving by so fast and your tongue, which you normally never have any problem keeping nice and wet, is somehow drying out in the wind and your eyes are flipping back and forth, grasping things that shine or glitter but not fast enough, you can just never quite get a good look at anything. What I mean by that, in case the metaphor missed, is that Every Sentence moves the plot forward and it is utterly exhausting.. The characters are flat and weird. They never change, are never motivated by anything other than their widely varying versions of human nature which they are born and die with and never evolve.. A lot of the time it is hard to discern the magic from the realism. Neither are very convincing, making the magic less magical and the realism less real. I've read that the 100 Years was influenced by Faulkner and I believe that, but wow, the worst parts of Faulkner. It feels like it's all the confusion and it tries to capture all the types and symbolism but it lacks the beauty and the depth. Just when you are getting used to a character or, for that matter, a generation of characters, suddenly so much time has gone by that you're now dealing with a whole new group of people, a new war, new relationships and the only things that give the book any continuity at all are Macondo and Ursula and the family names which repeat and add to the confusion.. If you want magical realism, and I know this is blasphemous, especially for someone who minored in Spanish, I'd say read Salman Rushdie or, if you really want Spanish, Borges or Carlos Fuentes. They represent the genre better. Maybe my opinion will change after I revisit Cien Años in English sometime in the future, but for now I really don't have much of a desire to do that at least not for the next 100 years or so. Oh yes I did."
11/04/2021,b18,r5890,575806,Kressel Housman,"Apr 29, 2008",2,"I love it when my Goodreads groups overlap thematically, so I was pleased when 101 Books chose this book for May just after I’d finished. The Last Days of the Incas. with the History group. Gabriel Garcia Marquez is from Colombia, not Peru, but I figured that even if the book would be set centuries after Spanish colonization, I’d still learn about its effects. But as it turns out, the book has no time setting at all. It really wasn’t much of a follow-up.. I knew the term “magical realism” before going into this book, but I’d never read any of the genre before, so I didn’t know exactly what to expect. The first fifty or so pages seemed realistic enough. There were some jumps back and forth in time, and the father of the family had an interest in alchemy and gypsy lore, but it wasn’t until the first ghost appeared that I thought, “Huh?” and then “Ohhh.” After that, the magical elements started coming fast and furious. And then, just as suddenly, they stopped again.. Another Goodreads reviewer posted Picasso’s “Guernica” and another painting by Salvador Dali for his review with the words, “Very nice, but what does it. mean. ?” That pretty much sums it up for me. Magical realism is a lot like a Dali painting. By themselves, the elements in the painting are not abstract and are recognizable, but as a whole, it’s surreal.. I was open to the novelty of it for the first half or so, but the final hundred pages were a torturous bore. Most of the characters are too cold-hearted to sympathize with. Sometimes, their motivations and actions are as bizarre as any of the supernatural elements. The character Fernanda got to go on a recognizably human rant, but that was only part of the second half that really held my attention. The rest was just a blur, probably because all the male characters at that point are named Aureliano.. This might be one of those books that is best read with a teacher to help interpret it. I sure don’t know what it means. And though I understand it’s a classic and that the author won the Nobel Prize, I can’t give it more than a 2. I liked the beginning, but there’s only so much Dadaism I can take."
11/04/2021,b18,r5891,11281532,Lita,"Jun 24, 2018",0,"[A 20th-century classic]. There are those books that come with high recommendations and must-read labels. Marquez's ""One Hundred Years of Solitude"" was definitely one of them. So I dove in expecting a page-turning literary masterpiece that will blow my mind (or something like that). I didn't get a page-turner, I probably got a literary masterpiece (not entirely sure about it though), and my mind wasn't blown (it was a bit stressed out by keeping track of all the Aurelianos and Jose Arcadios in what seemed like an endless bad choice of family names).. Anyhow, I'm finally done with the 422-page long drama of Buendía family and Macondo village. I can't really say what I think about this book because, on the one hand, I can see its merit and value in literature, but, on the other hand, I didn't find the message or the story as special as it seems to be portrayed by many admirers. If you decide to read the book, be prepared that it doesn't have a clear storyline. It follows the rise and fall of the Macondo village established by the first Buendía couple this side of the mountains and the six generations of the Buendía family for over a century. It's needless to say that the family members don't have an easy destiny. The changes brought about by different local, national, and global influences are taking the Buendías on a rollercoaster of life and death. For some, it's more than a hundred years long, but for others - very short.. The main message of the book becomes clear somewhere around the middle, but I think it's best summed up by Ursula towards the end of the book: ""[...] time was not passing, [...] it was turning in a circle."" The same goes for the book and our characters. It's emphasized with the repeating names of the Buendía sons and later also daughters (not helpful).. I won't give this book starred rating just because I don't know what it deserves. I cannot put it into any category of 'normal' books; it probably needs a classification of its own. I also can't say I enjoyed reading it, but it will stay with me for a while. But for all the book lovers out there, I need to end this review with one more quote: ""The world must be all fucked up when men travel first class and literature goes as freight."""
11/04/2021,b18,r5892,80857013,Mark,"Aug 03, 2019",4,"This was an epic read and I'm not actually sure where to begin in writing my response. I read somewhere that Gabriel García Márquez embodies magical realism in One Hundred Years of Solitude and somehow that really rings true. The book opens with all the energy of the gypsy visits to the isolated village of Macondo and Jose Arcadio Buendia's almost feverish devouring of the knowledge and invention that these visits bring. I found myself responding to this energy as I was reading these early chapters, witnessing Jose Arcadio Buendia literally filling up with newfound knowledge, magic and superstition.. The Buendia dynasty is overwhelming in its diversity yet similarity. The familial traits are seen throughout each generation and it seems like the book covers events that fill up multiple lifetimes over but yet are enclosed in this one family's generational lifetime.. The town of Macondo goes through amazing metamorphosis throughout the book, from isolation to civilisation and eventually back to isolation. It's like the town and the family are one a constant crescendo, only to eventually return to how they began. Perhaps this is the magical reality of it.. The characters for me were so representational of real life but exaggerated and overwhelming in their traits. I found myself identifying with many of the events and dark sides of the individuals involved. Gabriel García Márquez does not hold back in describing some of these events or relationships that are not in my realm of experience.. I did not find this book easy to read and a few times was tempted to put it down. I'm glad i persevered (although I admit to skimming a few chapters towards the end). An intriguing read, an epic dynasty and the rise and fall of a town has left a fair imprint on my mind."
